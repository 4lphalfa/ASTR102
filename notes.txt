Basic statements about the Universe that you might not have thought about
    - The Universe is finite
    - We have seen the edge of the observable Universe
    - The Universe is mostly empty space
    - The main constituents of the Universe are understood but unknown
    - Most matter is of unknown nature ('dark matter')
    - Radiation ('light') fills the Universe
    - Most energy is in a mysterious form ('dark enerty')
    - Most atoms that make up our bodies were manufactured in stars
    - Galaxies are basically 'empty'

Galaxies are basically 'empty'
If you were to pick a spot at random in a galaxy, how often would you land in a star?
        one in 10^23

Our place in Space
    - A galaxy like our Milky Way is about 100000 light years across
    - A light year is the distance light would trabel in a year, about 10000 billion km ~10^13 km
    - Another unit of distance commonly used in Astronomy is the "parsec" which is about 3.3 light years. (206265 AU)
        (AU: Average distane between the Earth and the Sun)

Scientific Theory and the Scientific Method
Astronomy is a Science
    Scientific Knowledge
        - The difference between "explanation" and "understanding"
        - A scientist should be able to "predict the future" through models
    Scientific Theories:
        - Must be testable
        - Must be continually tested
        - Should be simple
        - Should be elegant
    Scientific theories can be proven wrong, but they can never be proven right with 100 percent certainty.

Scientific Theory and the Scientific Method
    - Observation leads to theory explaining it.
    - Theory leads to predicitons consistent with previous observations
    - Predictions of new phenomena are observed. If the observations agree with the prediction, more predictions can be made. If not, a new theory should be made.

The "Obvious" View
    Simplest observation: 
        Look at the night sky
        About 3000 stars visible at any one time; distributed randomly but human brains tends to find patterns
    Groups stars into constellations:
        Figures having meaning to those doing the grouping
    Useful:
        Polaris, which is almost due north
    Useless:
        Astrology, which makes predictions about individuals based on the star patterns at their birth
    Stars that appear close in the sky may not actually be close in space
    The Celestial sphere:
        Stars seem to be on the inner surface of a sphere surrounding the Earth
        They aren't, but can use two-dimentional spherical coordinates (similar to latitude and longitude) to locate sky objects

Angular Measures
    - full circle contains 360 degrees
    - Each degree contains 60' (arc-minuted)
        * full moon/sun subtend half a degree on the sky, or ~30 arc-minutes
    - Each arc-minute contains 60" (arc-seconds)
    - Angular size of an object...

Daily motion of Stars
    All stars appear to trace "circles" on the sky, completing one per day

Earth's Orbital Motion
    - daily cicyle, noon to noon, is diurnal motion - solar day
    - Stars aren't in quite the same place 24 hours later, though, due to Earth's rotation around Sun; when they are once again in the same place, one sidereal day has passed.

1.4 Earth's Orbital Motion
Seasonal changes to night sky are due to Earth's motion around the Sun





==========

==========

Sidereal Day (23h 56min) - One rotation relative to the stars 
Solar Day (24h) - One rotation relative to the sun

Earth's Orbital Motion
    12 constellations Sun move through during the year are called the zodiac; the path is call the "Ecliptic"
    - Ecliptic is pane of Earth's path around SUN; at 23.5 degrees to celestial equator
    - Northernmost point of path (above celestial equator) is summer solstice; southernmost is winter solstice; points where path crosses celestial equator are vernal and automnal equinoxes
    - Combination of day length and sunlingt angle gives seasons
    - Time from one vernal equinox to next is tropical year
    Precession: rotation of earth's axis itself; makes one complete circle in about 26000 years
    Time for Earth to orbitonce around Sun, relative to fixed stars, is sidereal year
    Tropical year follows seasons; sidereal year follows constellations - in 13000 years July and August will still be summer, but Orion will be a summer constellation
    Tropical year is 20 min shorter than the sidereal year.

1.5 Motion of the Moon
    Moon takes about 29.5 days to go through whole cycle of phases - synodic month
    Phases are due to different amounts of sunlit portion being visible from Earth
    Time to make full 360 degree rotation around Earth, sidereal month, is about 2 days shorter due to motion around sun.
    Eclipses occur when Earth, Moon, and Sun form a straight line
    Lunar Eclipse:
        - Earth is between Moon and Sun
        - Partial when only part of Moon is in shadow
        - Total when it all is in shadow
    Solar Eclipse:
        - Moon is between earth and sun
        - Partial when only part of sun is blocked
        - Total when it all is blocked
        - Annular when Moon is too far from Earth for total
    Eclipses don't occur every month because Earth's and Moon's orbits are not in the same plane

The Measurement of Distance
    Triangulation: Measure baseline and angles, can calculate distance
    Parallax: Similar to triangluation, but look at apparent motion of object against distance background from two vantage points
    Measuring Earth's Radius: done by Eratosthenes about 2300 years ago; noticed that when Sun was directly overhead in one city, it was at an agnle in another
    Measuring that angle and the distance between the cities gives the radius

GAIA Spacecraft currently mapping Milky Way Galaxy
    - GAIA will map 3D positions over 1 billion stars
    - This represents only 1% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy
   


Ch2 The Copernican Revolution

Ancient Calenders
    - Across Europe, many stone structures were built to mark astronomical events

Babylonian Astronomy
    The Babyonians had complex mathematical models to describe the motions of the Moon and other planets.
    Their clay tablets provide us with the earliest written astronomical obesrvations, dating from around 1200 BC
    Western astronomy is directly desendent from Babylonian astronomy.

Ancient Astronomy
    Spokes of the Big Horn Medicine Wheel (WY, USA) are aligned with 
    This temple at Caracol, in Mexico, has many windows that are aligned with astronomical events

Mayan Astronomy: Dresden Codex - approx 1200 AD

Timeline
    Aristotle/Plato 400 BC
    Ptolemy 100 AD
    Gutenberg 1439 AD
    Luther 1517 AD
    Copernicus 1473-1543 AD
    G. Bruno 1548-1600 AD
    Galileo 1564-1642 AD
    Kepler 1571-1630
    Newton 1642-1727 AD

The Geocentric Universe
    Ancient astronomers observed the Sun, the Moon,...
    Planets ("Wanderers"):
        - Move with respect to fixed stars
        - Changed in brightness
        - Change speed
        - Undergo retrograde motion relative to fixed stars
    Inferior Planets: Mercury, Venus
    Superiro Planets: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
    Now know: 
        inferior planets have orbits closer to Sun than Earth's 
        Superiro planets' orbits are farther away
    Early observations:
        - inferiro planets never too far from Sun
        - Superior planets not tied to Sun; exhibit retrograde motion
        - ...

    Earliest modesl had Earth at center of solar system
    Needed lots of complications to accurately track planetary motions
    Planetary motions were one of the premier...
    
    Ptolemy's Complicated Cosmological System
        Each planet orbits around a small circle called an epicycle. 
        Each epicycle orbits on a larger circle called the deferent. 
        This system is not centerd exactly on Earth but on an offset point called the equant.

Geocentric Universe
    Hard to explain the retrograde motion of planets, used a concept called epicycles

Ptolemy's Complicated Cosmological System

Arabic Astromony
    Still based on the geocentric model
    Much of the terminology comes from Arabic astronomers

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543)
    Rediscovered the writings are Aristarcas
    The sun is the center

Copernicus' Model
    Predicted retrograde model
    Still relied on circles

Heliocentric vs Geocentric models
    They are mathematically equivilent

The Heliocentric Model of the solar system
    Explains what's happening with retrograde motion

The Foundations of the Copernican Revolution
    Earth is at the center of the moon's orbit
    All planets revolve around the sun
    The stars are far away because there is no observed paralax
    Motion of stars is because of the earth's rotation
    Earth is not the center of everything

Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)
    First astronmer to use telescopes 
    NOT the first to invent them
    Disovered evidence the contridict the geocentric model

    The birth of modern astronomy
        Looked at the Milky Way and saw it was made of many stars
        Discovered that the moon has mountains and valleys
        Observed the sun had sunspots and that it rotates, 1 month rotation
        Saw that Jupiter has moons
        Venus has phases
            The geocentric model can not explain this

Aristotle's view
    Based on meditation and thought
    Rest is the 'natural' state of matter

The New Science: Galileo's view
    Set up a physics lab

Inertia
    Experiments with pendulums
    Weight and speed of freefall

Planetary Motions
    Arrogant, made fun of people who didn't believe in the heliocentric model

Galileo's Trial
    Galileo was tried and convicted of heracy by the Roman Inquisition

The Heliocentric Universe
    Inferior planets: Mercury, Venus
    Superior planets: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn

The Laws of Planetary Motion
    Kepler's laws were derived using observations made by Tycho Brahe
    Tycho made very precice observations on Mars

Conic Sections
    Intersection of a plane with a cone

Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
    Planetary orbits are ellipses, SUn at one focus
    Imaginary line connecting Sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times (Closer to the sun means faster, further means slower)
    Square of period of planet's orbital motion is proportional to cube of semimajor axis (a^3 = p^2, a is distance, p is period)
    
Some properties of Planetary Orbits
    
Newton's Laws of motion
    An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object moving in a straight line at constant speed will not change its motion, unless and external force acts on it
    When a force is exerted on an object, its acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass: a = F/m
    When object A xerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A

Newton's Laws of gravity
    On the earth's surface, acceleration of gravity is approximately constant, and directed towards the center of earth
    For two massive objects, gravitational force is proportional to the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them
    The constant G is called the gravitational constant; it is measured experimentally and found to be  G = 6.67x10^-11
        F = GM1M2/r^2

Newtonian Mechanics
    The planets also exert a force on the sun
    This means that the sun moves as well ever so slightly
    Escape velocity: how fast something has to go to escape the earth's gravity

Einstein's Theory of General Relativity
    Gravity doesn't produce a force, but instead it curves/warps space time, resulting in an acceleration towards the centre of gravity
    
Proof of Einstein's Theories
    Gravity is due to a curvature of space-time
    When mass is introduced, space-time is warped
        Star light bends around the sun due to its mass warping space

Gravitational Lensing
    Light is bent by an intermediate galaxy to observe a galaxy that should not be seeable

Chapter 3: Radiation

Electromagnetic Radiation:
    ex. Light
    Light moves through the vacum of space

Waves in water
    Waves are a way of transmitting energy without transporting them along
    The particles are just moving up and down

Waves
    Wave Motion: Transmits energy without the physical trasport of material

Wave Properties
    Frequency: # of wave crests that pass a given point per second
    Period: Time between passage of sucessive crests
        Period = 1/Frequency
    Wavelength: Distance between sucessive crests
    Velocity: Speed at which crests move
        Velocity = Wavelength/Period

Waves in what?
    Most waves travel in a medium
    Light is an electromagnetic wave
    Change in electromagnetic field causes the waves

Electromagnetic waves:
    Oscillating electric and magnetic fields, Changing electric field creates magnetic field and vice versa

What's it traveling through
    The vacum of space
    The fabric of space time also contains electromagnetic fields and can have positive or negative fields

Speed of light:
    c = 299792458 m/s
    Sun to Earth: 8.32 min
    Andromeda Galaxy to Earth: 2.5 Million Years
        Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 Million light years away

Info from the Skies
    Visible Spectrum
    Skin can detect infared radiation
    
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
    No limit of wavelengths
    Different ranges have different names

The Wave Nature of Radiation
    Diffraction is purely a wave phenomenon.

Interference
    Is also a wave phenomenon
    Crests and troughs can add up to nothing
    "Double Slit Experiment"
    Constructive and Destructive interference

Thermal Radiation
Blackbody spectrum
    
The Kelvin Temperature Scale
    Water freezes at 273 K, boils at 373 K
    O K - All thermal motion stops

Thermal Radiation
    Radiation Laws
        1. Peak wavelength is inverseley proportional to temperature (frequency is directly proportional to temperature
        2. Total energy emitted is proportional to fourth power of temperature (note heavier curves)
        
More about the Radiation Laws
    Wien's Law: if we measure T in kelvin and lambda in mm, we find for the peak wavelength: lambda_max - 2.9 mm/T

The Echo of the Big Bang
    
The Perfect Black Body

Wien's law means that hotter stars produce much more high-frequency light

The Doppler Effect
    If one is moving toward a source of radiation, the wavelengths seems shorter; if moving aay, they seem lighter
    Depends only on the relative motion of source and observer
    Relationship between frequency and speed:
        Apparent Wavelength / True Wavelength = True Frequency / Apparent Frequency
                                              = 1 + Recession Velocity / Wave Speed

Measuing Velocities with the Doppler effect
