Basic statements about the Universe that you might not have thought about
    - The Universe is finite
    - We have seen the edge of the observable Universe
    - The Universe is mostly empty space
    - The main constituents of the Universe are understood but unknown
    - Most matter is of unknown nature ('dark matter')
    - Radiation ('light') fills the Universe
    - Most energy is in a mysterious form ('dark enerty')
    - Most atoms that make up our bodies were manufactured in stars
    - Galaxies are basically 'empty'

Galaxies are basically 'empty'
If you were to pick a spot at random in a galaxy, how often would you land in a star?
        one in 10^23

Our place in Space
    - A galaxy like our Milky Way is about 100000 light years across
    - A light year is the distance light would trabel in a year, about 10000 billion km ~10^13 km
    - Another unit of distance commonly used in Astronomy is the "parsec" which is about 3.3 light years. (206265 AU)
        (AU: Average distane between the Earth and the Sun)

Scientific Theory and the Scientific Method
Astronomy is a Science
    Scientific Knowledge
        - The difference between "explanation" and "understanding"
        - A scientist should be able to "predict the future" through models
    Scientific Theories:
        - Must be testable
        - Must be continually tested
        - Should be simple
        - Should be elegant
    Scientific theories can be proven wrong, but they can never be proven right with 100 percent certainty.

Scientific Theory and the Scientific Method
    - Observation leads to theory explaining it.
    - Theory leads to predicitons consistent with previous observations
    - Predictions of new phenomena are observed. If the observations agree with the prediction, more predictions can be made. If not, a new theory should be made.

The "Obvious" View
    Simplest observation: 
        Look at the night sky
        About 3000 stars visible at any one time; distributed randomly but human brains tends to find patterns
    Groups stars into constellations:
        Figures having meaning to those doing the grouping
    Useful:
        Polaris, which is almost due north
    Useless:
        Astrology, which makes predictions about individuals based on the star patterns at their birth
    Stars that appear close in the sky may not actually be close in space
    The Celestial sphere:
        Stars seem to be on the inner surface of a sphere surrounding the Earth
        They aren't, but can use two-dimentional spherical coordinates (similar to latitude and longitude) to locate sky objects

Angular Measures
    - full circle contains 360 degrees
    - Each degree contains 60' (arc-minuted)
        * full moon/sun subtend half a degree on the sky, or ~30 arc-minutes
    - Each arc-minute contains 60" (arc-seconds)
    - Angular size of an object...

Daily motion of Stars
    All stars appear to trace "circles" on the sky, completing one per day

Earth's Orbital Motion
    - daily cicyle, noon to noon, is diurnal motion - solar day
    - Stars aren't in quite the same place 24 hours later, though, due to Earth's rotation around Sun; when they are once again in the same place, one sidereal day has passed.

1.4 Earth's Orbital Motion
Seasonal changes to night sky are due to Earth's motion around the Sun

Sidereal Day (23h 56min) - One rotation relative to the stars 
Solar Day (24h) - One rotation relative to the sun

Earth's Orbital Motion
    12 constellations Sun move through during the year are called the zodiac; the path is call the "Ecliptic"
    - Ecliptic is pane of Earth's path around SUN; at 23.5 degrees to celestial equator
    - Northernmost point of path (above celestial equator) is summer solstice; southernmost is winter solstice; points where path crosses celestial equator are vernal and automnal equinoxes
    - Combination of day length and sunlingt angle gives seasons
    - Time from one vernal equinox to next is tropical year
    Precession: rotation of earth's axis itself; makes one complete circle in about 26000 years
    Time for Earth to orbitonce around Sun, relative to fixed stars, is sidereal year
    Tropical year follows seasons; sidereal year follows constellations - in 13000 years July and August will still be summer, but Orion will be a summer constellation
    Tropical year is 20 min shorter than the sidereal year.

1.5 Motion of the Moon
    Moon takes about 29.5 days to go through whole cycle of phases - synodic month
    Phases are due to different amounts of sunlit portion being visible from Earth
    Time to make full 360 degree rotation around Earth, sidereal month, is about 2 days shorter due to motion around sun.
    Eclipses occur when Earth, Moon, and Sun form a straight line
    Lunar Eclipse:
        - Earth is between Moon and Sun
        - Partial when only part of Moon is in shadow
        - Total when it all is in shadow
    Solar Eclipse:
        - Moon is between earth and sun
        - Partial when only part of sun is blocked
        - Total when it all is blocked
        - Annular when Moon is too far from Earth for total
    Eclipses don't occur every month because Earth's and Moon's orbits are not in the same plane

The Measurement of Distance
    Triangulation: Measure baseline and angles, can calculate distance
    Parallax: Similar to triangluation, but look at apparent motion of object against distance background from two vantage points
    Measuring Earth's Radius: done by Eratosthenes about 2300 years ago; noticed that when Sun was directly overhead in one city, it was at an agnle in another
    Measuring that angle and the distance between the cities gives the radius

GAIA Spacecraft currently mapping Milky Way Galaxy
    - GAIA will map 3D positions over 1 billion stars
    - This represents only 1% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy
   


Ch2 The Copernican Revolution

Ancient Calenders
    - Across Europe, many stone structures were built to mark astronomical events

Babylonian Astronomy
    The Babyonians had complex mathematical models to describe the motions of the Moon and other planets.
    Their clay tablets provide us with the earliest written astronomical obesrvations, dating from around 1200 BC
    Western astronomy is directly desendent from Babylonian astronomy.

Ancient Astronomy
    Spokes of the Big Horn Medicine Wheel (WY, USA) are aligned with 
    This temple at Caracol, in Mexico, has many windows that are aligned with astronomical events

The Geocentric Universe
    Ancient astronomers observed the Sun, the Moon,...
    Planets ("Wanderers"):
        - Move with respect to fixed stars
        - Changed in brightness
        - Change speed
        - Undergo retrograde motion relative to fixed stars
    Inferior Planets: Mercury, Venus
    Superiro Planets: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
    Now know: 
        inferior planets have orbits closer to Sun than Earth's 
        Superiro planets' orbits are farther away
    Early observations:
        - inferiro planets never too far from Sun
        - Superior planets not tied to Sun; exhibit retrograde motion
        - ...

    Earliest modesl had Earth at center of solar system
    Needed lots of complications to accurately track planetary motions
    Planetary motions were one of the premier...
    
    Ptolemy's Complicated Cosmological System
        Each planet orbits around a small circle called an epicycle. 
        Each epicycle orbits on a larger circle called the deferent. 
        This system is not centerd exactly on Earth but on an offset point called the equant.
