Basic statements about the Universe that you might not have thought about
    - The Universe is finite
    - We have seen the edge of the observable Universe
    - The Universe is mostly empty space
    - The main constituents of the Universe are understood but unknown
    - Most matter is of unknown nature ('dark matter')
    - Radiation ('light') fills the Universe
    - Most energy is in a mysterious form ('dark enerty')
    - Most atoms that make up our bodies were manufactured in stars
    - Galaxies are basically 'empty'

Galaxies are basically 'empty'
If you were to pick a spot at random in a galaxy, how often would you land in a star?
        one in 10^23

Our place in Space
    - A galaxy like our Milky Way is about 100000 light years across
    - A light year is the distance light would trabel in a year, about 10000 billion km ~10^13 km
    - Another unit of distance commonly used in Astronomy is the "parsec" which is about 3.3 light years. (206265 AU)
        (AU: Average distane between the Earth and the Sun)

Scientific Theory and the Scientific Method
Astronomy is a Science
    Scientific Knowledge
        - The difference between "explanation" and "understanding"
        - A scientist should be able to "predict the future" through models
    Scientific Theories:
        - Must be testable
        - Must be continually tested
        - Should be simple
        - Should be elegant
    Scientific theories can be proven wrong, but they can never be proven right with 100 percent certainty.

Scientific Theory and the Scientific Method
    - Observation leads to theory explaining it.
    - Theory leads to predicitons consistent with previous observations
    - Predictions of new phenomena are observed. If the observations agree with the prediction, more predictions can be made. If not, a new theory should be made.

The "Obvious" View
    Simplest observation: 
        Look at the night sky
        About 3000 stars visible at any one time; distributed randomly but human brains tends to find patterns
    Groups stars into constellations:
        Figures having meaning to those doing the grouping
    Useful:
        Polaris, which is almost due north
    Useless:
        Astrology, which makes predictions about individuals based on the star patterns at their birth
    Stars that appear close in the sky may not actually be close in space
    The Celestial sphere:
        Stars seem to be on the inner surface of a sphere surrounding the Earth
        They aren't, but can use two-dimentional spherical coordinates (similar to latitude and longitude) to locate sky objects

Angular Measures
    - full circle contains 360 degrees
    - Each degree contains 60' (arc-minuted)
        * full moon/sun subtend half a degree on the sky, or ~30 arc-minutes
    - Each arc-minute contains 60" (arc-seconds)
    - Angular size of an object...

Daily motion of Stars
    All stars appear to trace "circles" on the sky, completing one per day

Earth's Orbital Motion
    - daily cicyle, noon to noon, is diurnal motion - solar day
    - Stars aren't in quite the same place 24 hours later, though, due to Earth's rotation around Sun; when they are once again in the same place, one sidereal day has passed.

1.4 Earth's Orbital Motion
Seasonal changes to night sky are due to Earth's motion around the Sun





==========
2018-09-10
==========

Sidereal Day (23h 56min) - One rotation relative to the stars 
Solar Day (24h) - One rotation relative to the sun

Earth's Orbital Motion
    12 constellations Sun move through during the year are called the zodiac; the path is call the "Ecliptic"
    - Ecliptic is pane of Earth's path around SUN; at 23.5 degrees to celestial equator
    - Northernmost point of path (above celestial equator) is summer solstice; southernmost is winter solstice; points where path crosses celestial equator are vernal and automnal equinoxes
    - Combination of day length and sunlingt angle gives seasons
    - Time from one vernal equinox to next is tropical year
    Precession: rotation of earth's axis itself; makes one complete circle in about 26000 years
    Time for Earth to orbitonce around Sun, relative to fixed stars, is sidereal year
    Tropical year follows seasons; sidereal year follows constellations - in 13000 years July and August will still be summer, but Orion will be a summer constellation
    Tropical year is 20 min shorter than the sidereal year.

1.5 Motion of the Moon
    Moon takes about 29.5 days to go through whole cycle of phases - synodic month
    Phases are due to different amounts of sunlit portion being visible from Earth
    Time to make full 360 degree rotation around Earth, sidereal month, is about 2 days shorter due to motion around sun.
    Eclipses occur when Earth, Moon, and Sun form a straight line
    Lunar Eclipse:
        - Earth is between Moon and Sun
        - Partial when only part of Moon is in shadow
        - Total when it all is in shadow
    Solar Eclipse:
        - Moon is between earth and sun
        - Partial when only part of sun is blocked
        - Total when it all is blocked
        - Annular when Moon is too far from Earth for total
    Eclipses don't occur every month because Earth's and Moon's orbits are not in the same plane

The Measurement of Distance
    Triangulation: Measure baseline and angles, can calculate distance
    Parallax: Similar to triangluation, but look at apparent motion of object against distance background from two vantage points
    Measuring Earth's Radius: done by Eratosthenes about 2300 years ago; noticed that when Sun was directly overhead in one city, it was at an agnle in another
    Measuring that angle and the distance between the cities gives the radius

GAIA Spacecraft currently mapping Milky Way Galaxy
    - GAIA will map 3D positions over 1 billion stars
    - This represents only 1% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy
   


Ch2 The Copernican Revolution

Ancient Calenders
    - Across Europe, many stone structures were built to mark astronomical events

Babylonian Astronomy
    The Babyonians had complex mathematical models to describe the motions of the Moon and other planets.
    Their clay tablets provide us with the earliest written astronomical obesrvations, dating from around 1200 BC
    Western astronomy is directly desendent from Babylonian astronomy.

Ancient Astronomy
    Spokes of the Big Horn Medicine Wheel (WY, USA) are aligned with 
    This temple at Caracol, in Mexico, has many windows that are aligned with astronomical events

Mayan Astronomy: Dresden Codex - approx 1200 AD

Timeline
    Aristotle/Plato 400 BC
    Ptolemy 100 AD
    Gutenberg 1439 AD
    Luther 1517 AD
    Copernicus 1473-1543 AD
    G. Bruno 1548-1600 AD
    Galileo 1564-1642 AD
    Kepler 1571-1630
    Newton 1642-1727 AD

The Geocentric Universe
    Ancient astronomers observed the Sun, the Moon,...
    Planets ("Wanderers"):
        - Move with respect to fixed stars
        - Changed in brightness
        - Change speed
        - Undergo retrograde motion relative to fixed stars
    Inferior Planets: Mercury, Venus
    Superiro Planets: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
    Now know: 
        inferior planets have orbits closer to Sun than Earth's 
        Superiro planets' orbits are farther away
    Early observations:
        - inferiro planets never too far from Sun
        - Superior planets not tied to Sun; exhibit retrograde motion
        - ...

    Earliest modesl had Earth at center of solar system
    Needed lots of complications to accurately track planetary motions
    Planetary motions were one of the premier...
    
    Ptolemy's Complicated Cosmological System
        Each planet orbits around a small circle called an epicycle. 
        Each epicycle orbits on a larger circle called the deferent. 
        This system is not centerd exactly on Earth but on an offset point called the equant.

Geocentric Universe
    Hard to explain the retrograde motion of planets, used a concept called epicycles

Ptolemy's Complicated Cosmological System

Arabic Astromony
    Still based on the geocentric model
    Much of the terminology comes from Arabic astronomers

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543)
    Rediscovered the writings are Aristarcas
    The sun is the center

Copernicus' Model
    Predicted retrograde model
    Still relied on circles

Heliocentric vs Geocentric models
    They are mathematically equivilent

The Heliocentric Model of the solar system
    Explains what's happening with retrograde motion

The Foundations of the Copernican Revolution
    Earth is at the center of the moon's orbit
    All planets revolve around the sun
    The stars are far away because there is no observed paralax
    Motion of stars is because of the earth's rotation
    Earth is not the center of everything

Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)
    First astronmer to use telescopes 
    NOT the first to invent them
    Disovered evidence the contridict the geocentric model

    The birth of modern astronomy
        Looked at the Milky Way and saw it was made of many stars
        Discovered that the moon has mountains and valleys
        Observed the sun had sunspots and that it rotates, 1 month rotation
        Saw that Jupiter has moons
        Venus has phases
            The geocentric model can not explain this

Aristotle's view
    Based on meditation and thought
    Rest is the 'natural' state of matter

The New Science: Galileo's view
    Set up a physics lab

Inertia
    Experiments with pendulums
    Weight and speed of freefall

Planetary Motions
    Arrogant, made fun of people who didn't believe in the heliocentric model

Galileo's Trial
    Galileo was tried and convicted of heracy by the Roman Inquisition

The Heliocentric Universe
    Inferior planets: Mercury, Venus
    Superior planets: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn

The Laws of Planetary Motion
    Kepler's laws were derived using observations made by Tycho Brahe
    Tycho made very precice observations on Mars

Conic Sections
    Intersection of a plane with a cone

Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
    Planetary orbits are ellipses, SUn at one focus
    Imaginary line connecting Sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times (Closer to the sun means faster, further means slower)
    Square of period of planet's orbital motion is proportional to cube of semimajor axis (a^3 = p^2, a is distance, p is period)
    
Some properties of Planetary Orbits
    
Newton's Laws of motion
    An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object moving in a straight line at constant speed will not change its motion, unless and external force acts on it
    When a force is exerted on an object, its acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass: a = F/m
    When object A xerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A

Newton's Laws of gravity
    On the earth's surface, acceleration of gravity is approximately constant, and directed towards the center of earth
    For two massive objects, gravitational force is proportional to the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them
    The constant G is called the gravitational constant; it is measured experimentally and found to be  G = 6.67x10^-11
        F = GM1M2/r^2

Newtonian Mechanics
    The planets also exert a force on the sun
    This means that the sun moves as well ever so slightly
    Escape velocity: how fast something has to go to escape the earth's gravity

Einstein's Theory of General Relativity
    Gravity doesn't produce a force, but instead it curves/warps space time, resulting in an acceleration towards the centre of gravity
    
Proof of Einstein's Theories
    Gravity is due to a curvature of space-time
    When mass is introduced, space-time is warped
        Star light bends around the sun due to its mass warping space

Gravitational Lensing
    Light is bent by an intermediate galaxy to observe a galaxy that should not be seeable

Chapter 3: Radiation

Electromagnetic Radiation:
    ex. Light
    Light moves through the vacum of space

Waves in water
    Waves are a way of transmitting energy without transporting them along
    The particles are just moving up and down

Waves
    Wave Motion: Transmits energy without the physical trasport of material

Wave Properties
    Frequency: # of wave crests that pass a given point per second
    Period: Time between passage of sucessive crests
        Period = 1/Frequency
    Wavelength: Distance between sucessive crests
    Velocity: Speed at which crests move
        Velocity = Wavelength/Period

Waves in what?
    Most waves travel in a medium
    Light is an electromagnetic wave
    Change in electromagnetic field causes the waves

Electromagnetic waves:
    Oscillating electric and magnetic fields, Changing electric field creates magnetic field and vice versa

What's it traveling through
    The vacum of space
    The fabric of space time also contains electromagnetic fields and can have positive or negative fields

Speed of light:
    c = 299792458 m/s
    Sun to Earth: 8.32 min
    Andromeda Galaxy to Earth: 2.5 Million Years
        Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 Million light years away

Info from the Skies
    Visible Spectrum
    Skin can detect infared radiation
    
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
    No limit of wavelengths
    Different ranges have different names

The Wave Nature of Radiation
    Diffraction is purely a wave phenomenon.

Interference
    Is also a wave phenomenon
    Crests and troughs can add up to nothing
    "Double Slit Experiment"
    Constructive and Destructive interference

Thermal Radiation
Blackbody spectrum
    
The Kelvin Temperature Scale
    Water freezes at 273 K, boils at 373 K
    O K - All thermal motion stops

Thermal Radiation
    Radiation Laws
        1. Peak wavelength is inverseley proportional to temperature (frequency is directly proportional to temperature
        2. Total energy emitted is proportional to fourth power of temperature (note heavier curves)
        
More about the Radiation Laws
    Wien's Law: if we measure T in kelvin and lambda in mm, we find for the peak wavelength: lambda_max - 2.9 mm/T

The Echo of the Big Bang
    
The Perfect Black Body

Wien's law means that hotter stars produce much more high-frequency light

The Doppler Effect
    If one is moving toward a source of radiation, the wavelengths seems shorter; if moving aay, they seem lighter
    Depends only on the relative motion of source and observer
    Relationship between frequency and speed:
        Apparent Wavelength / True Wavelength = True Frequency / Apparent Frequency
                                              = 1 + Recession Velocity / Wave Speed

Measuing Velocities with the Doppler effect

Spectroscopy

Refraction of Light
    Refraction: light travels through different materials at different speeds
    Fermat's Principle: Light slows down in water and changes path to minimize the time it takes to reach a particular point
    Prism: Blue light 'bends more' than red light

Gravitational Lenzing
    Fermat's Principle: Gravity may produce multiple images of distant stars

Spectral Lines
    Spectroscope: Splits light into component colours
    Emmission lines: Single frequencies emitted by partucular atoms
    "The fingerprint of an atom"
    Emission spectrum can be used to identify elements

Absorption Spectrum
    If a continuous spectrum passes through a cool gas, atoms of the gas will absorb the same frequencies they emit
    The cool gas absorbs some of the light and create dark lines, gives the signature of the atom

Spectral Lines
    An absorbtion spectrum can also be used to identify elements. 
    Absorption is inverse of Emission

Kirchhoff's Laws
    1. Luminous solid, liquid, or dense gas produces continuous spectrum (essentially a "black boody")
    2. Low-density hot gas produces emission spectrum
    3. Continuous spectrum incident on cool, thin gas prduces absorption spectrum

Atoms and Radiation
    Existense of spectral lines required new model of atom, so that only certain amounts ("quanta") of energy could be emitted or absorbed
    Bohr model had certain allowed orbits for electron in the hydrogen atom

The Hydrogen Aom
    Energy levels of the hydrogen aton, showing tow series of emission lines:
        The energies of the electron in each orbit are given by: E_n = 13.6(1-1/n^2)eV
        The emission lines corresponding to the energy differences 
        eV = electron-Volt (a unit of energy)

The Photoelectric Effect
    Photoelectric effect can only be understood if light behaves like particles
    The Photoelectric Effect:
        When light shines on metal, electrons can be emitted
        Frequency must be higher than minimum, characteristic of material
        Increaed frequency -- more energetic electrons
        Increased intensity -- more electrons, same energy

Atoms and Radiation
    Light particles ("Photons") each have energy E
    ...

Wave-Particle Duality
    If light is made of 'particles' how can effects like diffraction or interference coour? Thie is one ot the conundrums addressed by Quantum Mechanics
    'Particles' follow 'paths' with different probabilities. Luminous fringes form where probabilities are highter, dark fringes where probabilitieis are lowest

De Broglie Wavelengths
    Actually, all particles may be thought of as being 'waves'. The wavelength depends on the 'momentum (p)' of a particle (usually,, its mass times its velocity). 
    For an electron, its wavelengths is about the size of it's orbit around the atom
    Electrons occilate around the neucleus, but can be out of sync with each other

Formation of Spectral Lines
    Absorption can boost an electron to the second (or higher) execited state
    Absorption spectrum: Created when atoms absorb photons of right energy for excitation
    Multielectron atoms: Much more complicated spectra, many more possible states
    Ionization changes energy levels
    Emission lines can be used to identify atoms

Modern Spectrographs
    

Telescopes

Planar Waves
    Light recieved from a very distant object behaves like "planar waves"
    These may also be represented by parallel "rays" 

Lenses and Telescope
    A simple telescope is a refracting lense
    Recall Fermat's Principle. Rays follow paths that minimize the time it takes to reach the focus.

Optical Telescopes
    Images can be formed through reflection or refraction
    A reflecting (parabolic) mirror may be used as a telescope
    The parabolic shape is critical. A spherical mirror is not able to produce images
    The Hubble Spaec Telescope (HST) provides a sobering example
        Mirror was shaped incorrectly
    Reflecting and refracting telescopes
    Telescopes are "light buckets" used to gather as much light as possible
    Modern telescopes are all reflectors. Why?
        Light traveling through lens is refracted differently depending on wavelength
        SOme light traveling through lens is absorbed
        Large lens can be bery heave, and can only be supported at edge
        A lens needs two optically acceptable surfaces; mirror needs only one

Refracting Telescopes (lenses)
    Yerkes Observator has a 40" diamater lense, the largest in the world. It was built in 1890 and is still used today

Reflecting Telescopes (mirrors)
    The Keck telescope, a 10m-diameter optical telescope sited as the summit of Mauna Kea
    Keck uses a segmented mirror in order to improve its shape control and to accommondate it to atmospheric fluctuations

Kirchhoff's laws
    In the absorption spectrum, emission lines are still there but are so faint that they look dark
    
Optical Telescopes

Chromatic Aberration
    can be resolved for two colours simultaneously, but not for three

Optical Telescopes
    The Hubble Soace Telescope has a variety of detectors:
        Ultraviolet
        Infrared
    The Hubble Space Telescope's main mirror is 2.4m in diameter and is designed for visible, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation

Telescope Size
    Light Gathering Power: Improves detail by allowing fainter features to be observed
    Brightness of an image proportional to square of radius of mirror. A 5m telescope observe and object 25x faster than a 1m telescope

Diffraction limit
    The wavelength of light and the telescope size determine the resolution power of a telescope
    Diffraction limits the resolution of radio telescopes
    Larger wavelengths causes more diffraction

Telescope Size
    Resolving power: when better can distinguish objects better...

The Largest telescopes on earth
    Mauna Kea in Hawaii
        Gemini-north
        Canada-France-Hawaii
        Keck 1&2
        Subaru
    The Gran TeCan(10.4m) - La Palma
    ESO VLT - Paranel, Chile 
    Magic Telescopes - Largest gamma ray telescopes - 17m

Images and Detectors
    Image acquisition: charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are electronic devices, which can be quickly read out and reset
    Image processing by computers can sharpen images

Atmospheric Effect
    Atmospheric bluring is due to air movements (Turbulence")
    This is why stars 'twinkle' -- limits the resolution of ground based optical telescopes
        "Seeing" - Atmospheric turbulance (Lower is better)

High Resolution Astronomy 
    Solutions:
        Put telescopes on mountaintops, especially in deserts
        Put telescopes in space
    Adaptie optics: control mirrors based on temperature and orientation

Adaptive optics
    Distorted wavefronts are reflected by an adaptive distorting mirror
    Some of the wavefronts are sent to a sensor to analyze the distortion
    This sensor configures the adaptive distorting mirror in real time

High Resolution Astronomy
    Adaptive optics: track atmospheric changes with laser; adjust mirrors in real time

Active optics
    the mirror's own weight will cause it to deform. The telescope will correct for this once it is in a set position.

Radio Astronomy
    Radio telescopes
        similar to optical reflecting telescopes
        Radio wavelengths are about a million times longer than visible light
        Less sensitive to imperfections (due to longer wavelengths); can be made very large
    Largest radio telescop eis the 300m dish at Arecibo, Puerto Rico
    Lower wavelength means poor angular resolution
    Advantages of radio astronomy
        can oberve 24 hours a day
        can observe through clouds, rain, etc
        observes at a completely different frequency; different info

Diffraction limit
    The wavelength of light and the telescope size determine the resolution power of a telescope
    Diffraction limits the resolution of radio telescopes
    
Interferometry
    Combines info from several widely spread radio telescopes as if it came from a single dish
    Resolution will be that of dish whose diameter = largest separation between dishes
    Can get radio images whose resolution is close to optical
    Interferometry can also be done with visible light, but is much more difficult due to shorter wavelengths
    
The ALMA Array
    Resolution can be improved with 'arrays of telescopes"
    The ALMA Array is a set of 66 radiotelescopes located in norther Chile, which detect radiation with wavelengths between 0.3mm and 10mm
    The antennas are mobile

Resolution is worse with long-wave light, so radio telescopes must be large to compensate

Space Based Astronomy
    Ground based observations in the far infrared, microwave, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma ray bands is difficulty or virtually impossible because the atmosphere absorbs much of the radiation
    These observations are carried out from either stratospheric ballons or satellites
    Ultraviolet observing must be done is space, as the atmosphere absorbes almost all ultraviolet rays
    X-rays and gamma rays will not reflect off mirrors as other wavelengths do; need new techniques
    X-rays will reflect at a very shallow angle and can therefore be focused

Ch 16 The Sun
The Source of essentially all energy sources on the Earth

"A star like many others..."
    Understanding the sund means understanding also other stars
    Laws of Physics are the same in other parts of the universe
    We are not "priviledged observers"
    There must be physical reason for why the Sun is the way it is
Our Sun is a red/white

The Astronomical Unit
    Average distance between the Earth and the Sun

The Habitable Zone

The Scales of the Solar System
    The Sun is aprox 109 Earth diameters, 300x the Earth's mass

Physical Properties of the Sun
    Radius: 700000 km
        Trig may be used to infer it from the Sun's apparent size and it's distance to Earth
        Sun's distance to earth may be inferred from Moon's Distance and radius since they have similar angular size
        Moon's distance may be measured through parallax (2 observers measure position at the same time)
    Mass: 20x10^30 kg
        Derived from Newton's laws; uses the orbital period of earth and the distance sun-earth
        the force keeping the Earth in orbit is the gravity of the Sun (G is Newton's gravitational constant
            M = rv^2/G
    Density: 1400 kg/m^3
    roation: Differential, period about a month
        Equator rotates quicker than the poles
    Surface temp:
        Apparent surface is called 'photosphere'

Sunspots
    Sun's rotation may be measured tracking 'sunspots'. These are dark spots caused by magnetic storms on the Sun's 'photosphere'
    
Physical Properties of the Sun
    Luminosity: Total energy radiated by the Sun -- can be calculated from the fraction of that energy that reaches Earth
    Solar Constant: amount of Sun's energy reaching Earth -- is 1400 W/m^2
    Total lumonosity is about 4x10^26 W -- the equivalent of 10 billion 1-megaton nuclear bombs per second

Physical Properties of the Sun: the Solar Constant

The Solar Interior: What keeps the sun in equilibrium
    Mathmatical models, consistent with observations and physical principles, provide information about the Sun's interior
    ...

The Solar Interior
    Doppler shifts of solar spectral lines indicate a complex pattern of vibrations. The Sun "boils"
    This may be used to construct a "sonogram" of the Sun. 

Physical Properties of the Sun
    Interior structure of the Sun:
        Core
            nuclear fusion takes place here
        Radiation Zone
            transparent to radiation
        Convection Zone
        Photosphere
            dense enough to produce black body spectrum, but low enough density so that energy can escpae
        Chromosphere
            lower atmosphere of the Sun
        Transition Zone
            transitions from lower temp to higher temp
        Carona

The Solar Interior
    Solar density and temperature, according to the standard solar model
    Energy Transport:
        The radiation zone is relatively transparent; the cooler convection zone is opaque
        Photons are constantly being absorbed and then re-emitted
        Can take from a thousand to a million years to escape

The Sun's Atmosphere
    Spectral analysis can tell us what elements are present, but only in the chromosphere and photosphere of the Sun. This spectrum has lines from 67 different elements.
    These lines are produced by cool, low-density gas "clouds" on top of the Sun's "surface" -- the photosphere

The Composition of our Sun
    Mostly hydrogen and helium
    Elements like iron have very strong absorption lines
    Hydrogen and helium do not have strong absorption lines

Cecilia Helena Payne Gaposchkin (1900-1979)
    Temperature and pressure affects the strength of the spectral lines
    Contrubuted to the discovery of the makeup of the Sun and other stars

The Sun's Atmosphere
    The cooler chromosphere is above the photosphere
    Difficult to see directly, as photosphere is too bright, unless moon covers photosphere and not chromosphere during eclipse.
    Small solar storms in chromosphere emit spicules

The Sun's Atmosphere
    Solar corona can be seen during eclipse if both photosphere and chromosphere are blocked
    Corona is much hotter than layers below it -- must have a heat source, probably electromagnetic interactions

Solar Magnetism
    Sunspots: Appear dark because slightly cooler than surroundings (by about 1000 degrees)
    Sunspots come and go, typically in a few days
    Sunspots are linked by pairs of magnetic field lines
    Sunspots originate when magnetic field lines are distorted by Sun's differential rotation
        Every 11 years, the magnetic fields flip, 22 years for a full rotation
        The uneven spin of the Sun distorts the magnetic field
        If a loop occurs near the edge of teh sun, we see it as a prominence
        Which hemisphere affects the direction traveled of the magnetic field
    The SUn has an 11-year sunspot cycle, during which sunspot numbers rise, fall, and then rise again

The Active Sun
    Areas around sunspots are active; large eruptions may occur in photosphere
    Solar prominence is large sheet of ejected gas
    Solar flare is a large explosion of Sun's surface, emitting a similar amount of energy to a prominence, but in seconds or minutes rather than days or weeks
    Coronal mass ejection occurs when a large "bubble" detaches from the sun and escapes into space

Solar Wind
    High above the photosphere, charged particles (electrons, protons, helium nuclei) escape the sun
    The sun's upper atmosphere is constantly evaporating and being replenished
    Every second, 2 million tonnes of matter are carried away by winds
    The sun has been doing this for 4.6 billion(?) years

What is responsible for the corona's higher temperatures far from the surface
    The suns' magnetic field acts like a pump and sends particles up

The Heart of the SUn
    Given the sun's mass and energy production, we find that, on the average, every kilogram of the sun produces about 0.2 milliwatts of energy
    This is not much ....
    ....
    Nuclear fusion is the energy source for the Sun
    In general, muclear fusion works like this:
        nucleus 1 + nucleus 2 -> nucleus 3 + energy
    But where does the energy come from?
    It comes from the mass; if you add up the masses of the inital nuclei, you will find the result is more than the mass of the final nucleus
    The relationship between ....
    ....
    Nuclear fusion requires that like-charged nuclei get close enough to each other to fuse. 
    But like chages repel each other
    This can happen only if the temperature is extremely high -- over 10 millin K

What holds nuclei together
    Strong Force
        What holds the stuff together
    Electromagnetic force
    Weak Force
        Responsible for radioactive decay
    Gravity

Fusion: The Basics
    Hydrogen
    Deuterium (Heavy Water, one neutron)
    Tritium (two neutrons)

The Colour of the sun (Lym colour effect)
    When we look into the photosphere, the deeper we go the hotter it is
    When we look at the edge, we see more of the cooler photosphere


The Heart of the Sun
    Nuclear fusion is the energy source for the sun
        Fuses hydrogen into helium, reduced mass becomes energy
    Requires that like-charged particles get close enough to fuse
    But like charges repel each others
    This can happen only if the temperature is extremely high -- over 10 million K
    This is called the strong force
    The image depicts proton-proton fusion. In this reaction:
        proton + proton -> deuteron + positron + neutrino
    The positron is just like the electron except positively charged: the neutrino is also related to the electron but has no charge and very little, if any, mass
    In more conventional notation
        1H + 1H -> 2H + positron + neutrino
    This is the first step in a three-step fusion process that powers most stars: The P-P Chain
        4 protons fuse to make Helium-4
    The ultimate result of the process:
        4(^1H) -> ^4He + energy + 2 neutrinos
    The helium stays in the core
    The energy is in the form of gamma rays, which gradually lose their energy as they travel out from the core, emerging as visible light
    The neutrinos escape without interacting
    The energy created in the whole reaction can be calculated by the difference in mass between the initial particles and the final ones -- for each interaction it turns out to be 4.3x10...

Neutrinos
    Neutrios are tiny, almost massless, neutral particles produced by nuclear fusion
    They travel near the speed of light and barely ever interact with anything! (They can travel through a light year of lead and not interact with any atoms)

Observations of solar neutrios
    Neutrinos are emitted directly from the core of the Sun and escape, interacting with virtually nothing. 
        Being able to observe these neutrinos would give us a direct picutre of what is happening in the core
    Unfortunately, they are no more likely to interact with earth-based detectors than they are with the Sun; 
        the only way to spot them is to have a huge detector volume and to be able to observe single interaction events
    Typical solar neutrino detector resolution is very poor
    Detection of solar neutrinos has always been a deficit in the type of neutrinos expected to be emitted by the sun
    Recent research...

How long do protons take to escape the sun
    hundreds of thousands to millions of years


Ch17 Measuring the Stars
    
The Solar Neighbourhood
    To decide which stars are intrinsicall brighter we nned to measure their distances.
    Remember parallax?
        The closer the object, the greater the parallax shift
    Triangulation
    Parallax
        Half the angle shift is the parallax angle

GAIA Spacecraft currently mapping Milky Way galaxy
    GAIA will map 3d positions over 1 billion stars
    This represents only 1% of the stars in the Milky Way

Arcseconds and Parsecs
    1 Degree = 3600 arcseconds = 3600" (like one hour is 3600 seconds)
    60 arcseconds = 1 arcminute = 1'
    1 parsec (pc) is the distance of a star if its measured parallax angle is exactly one arcsecond (about 3.3 light years)
    ...

The Solar Neighbourhood
    Nearest star to the Sun: Proxima Centauri, which is a member of the three-star system Alpha Centauri complex
    To get an idea: if Sun is a marble, Earth is a grain of sand orbiting 1 m away, the nearest star is another marble 270 km away
    Solar system extends about 50 m from Sun; rest of distance to nearest star is basically empty

Oort cloud, edge of our solar system

Stellar Proper Motions
    Some stars may also move relative to other fixed objects on the sky: this is called proper motion
    Barnard's star has the largest proper motion of any star -- proper motion is the actual shift of the star in the sky, after correcting for parallax

Actual Motion of the Alpha centauri complex
    Radical velocities are measured from the Doppler shift of spectral lines
    Tangential velocities are inferred from the star's distance and proper motion

Stellar Paralax can be used to measure the distance of stars
A star's real space motion combines its apparent proper motion with its radial motion toward or away from earth
    A star's proper motion is the annual apparent motion across the sky

Luminosity and Apparent Brightness
    Luminosity is a measure of the total power (energy per unit time) radiated by a star
    Apparent brightness is how bright a star appears when biewed from earth: it depends on the absolute brightness but also on the distance of the star. It is a measure of 'energy flux'
    * Luminosity passing through each spear is the same
    * Area of sphere: 4(pi)r^2
    * Divide luminosity by are subtended by telescope to get brightness
    (Light obeys the inverse square law)
    If we know a star's apparent brightness and its distance...

Aparent Magnitudes
    The magnitude scale is the system we use to describe how bright a given objects is 
    Hipparchus came p with this system completely by eye
    He rated stars on a scale from 1-6
    1 = bright, 6 = faint
    (but now we use all real numbers)
    A difference of 5 magnitudes (1 to 6) corresponds to a factor of 100 change in brightness
    So an object of magnitude 1 is 100 time brighter than a magnitude 6...
    ...

Apparent Magnitude - examples
    A star of magnitude 1 is 2.51 times brighter than a star of magnitude 2
    A star of magnitude 2 is 2.51 times brighter than a star of magnitude 3...
    Verify: Magnitude 6 to magnitude 1 = factor of 100 brightness
        2.51^ = 100
    ...

Aboslute Magnitudes
    The Absolute Magnitude is the magnitude an object would have if the object was 10pc away (33 light years)
    The absolute magnitude puts objects at an equal distance so we can compare their actual brightnesses (Luminisoty)
    We only use the absolute magnitude to compare objects to one another

Magnitude Scales
    Apparent luminosity/brightness is measured by astronomers using a magnitude scale, which is related to our perception
    It is a logarithmic scale; a change of 5 in magnitude corresponds to a change of a factor of 100 in apparent brightness
    It is also inverted -- larger magnitudes are dimmer

Magnitude Summary
    Apparent magnitude is the brightness of the star as seen from earth
    Absolute magnitude is the brightness a star would have a distance of 10 parsecs
    ....

Magnatude Summary
    Apparent and Absolute Magnitudes
        Apparent is the brightness of the star as seen from the Earth
        Absolute is the brightness a star would have at a distance of 10 parsecs
            Measure intrinsic brightness or luminosity

Magnitude to Luminosity conversion
    Converting from magnitude to luminosity in solar units: this graph allows us to perform this conversion simply by readiong horizontally. 
    A reduction of 5 in magnitude corresponds to an increase in a factor of 100 in luminosity, as it should.

Stellar Temperatures
    The color of a star is indicative of its temperature.
    Red stars are relatively cool, where as blue ones are hotter.
    Why?
        Hotter is shorter wavelength, cooler is longer
    The radiation from stars is blackbody radiation.
    The blackbody curve is not symmetric
    Observantions at two wavelengths are enough to define the temperature
        Only need 2 measurements
        Tells us about the temperature of the object
    Stellar spectra are much more informative tha the blackbody curves
    There are seven general categories of stellar spectra, corresponding to different temperatures
    From highest to lowest, those categories are
        O B A F G K M
        Only Boring Astronomers Find Gratitude Knowing Mnemonics
    Characteristics of the spectral classifications

Stellar Sizes
    A very few large, very close stars can ve imaged directly using speckle interferometry.
    Stellar radii vary widely
    Stars come in many different sizes: dwarfs, subgiants, supergiants, etc
    For the vast majority of stars that cannot be imaged directly, size must be inferred from their luminosity and temperature

Estimating Stellar Radii

The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram
    distinctly see there are populations of stars
    What can one do with luminosities and temperatures?
    The H-R diagram plots stellar luminosity agaisnt surface temperature
    Once many stars are plotted on an H-R diagram, a pattern begins to form
    The darkened curve is called the main sequence, as this is where most stars are
    Also indicated is the white dwarf region: these stars are hot but not bery luminous
    Two other categories, red giants and the blue giants
    Clearly, the brightest stars in the sky appear bright because of their enoumous ...
    About 90% of stars lie on the main sequence; 9% are red giants and 1% are white dwarfs
    But why do stars distribute themselves this way...

H-R plots stars based off of luminosity and temperature (brightness and colour)

Extending the Cosmic Distance Scale
    Spectroscopic Paralax: Has nothing to do with parallax, but does use spectroscopy in finding the distance to a star
    1. Measure the star's apparent magnitude and spectral class
    2. Use spectral class to estimate luminosity
    3. Apply inverse-square law to find distance
    Spectroscopic parallax can extend the cosmic distance scales to several thousand parsecs
        More theoretical, not nearly as precise (10-20% accurate)
    The spectroscopic parallax calculation can be misleading if the star is not on the main sequence. The width of spectral lines could be used to define luminosity classes.
    in this way, giants and supergiants can ve distinguished from main-sequence stars

Stellar Masses
    Determining of stellar masses:
        Many stars are in binary pairs; measurement of their orbital motion allows determination of the masses of the stars
        Visual binaries can be measured directly
    Spectroscopic binaries can be measured using their Doppler shifts
    Finally, eclipsing binaries can be measured using the changes in luminosity. This is the same as one of the methods used to discover extrasolar planets
    Mass is the main determinant of where a star will be on the main sequence
        Higher luminosity = higher mass = higher temp (For stars on the main sequence)

Stellar Lifetimes
    Mass is also related to stellar lifetime
        the higher the mass, die very quickly
    So the most massive stars habe the shortest lifetime -- they have a lot of fuel, but burn it very quickly

Ch18 The Interstellar Medium

The Interstellar Medium
    Interstellar gas cloud (nebula) visible to the naked eye: the Orion Nebula
    A wide-angle view of the Milky Way -- the dark regions are dust clouds, blocking light from the stars beyond

    The interstellar medium consists of gas and dust
    Gas is atoms and small molecules, mostly hydrogen and helium
    Dust is more like soot or smoke; arger clumps of particles
    Dust absorbs light, and reddens light that gets through
    Reddening can interfere with blackbody temperature measurement, but spectral likes do not shift
    
Light Absorbtion
    This image illustrates how reddening works. On the right, the upper image was made using visible light; the lower wa made using infrared
        the light that goes through the cloud absorbs more light at shorter wavelengts
The Interstellar Medium absorbs light more strongly as shorter wavelengths

Interstellar Matter
    Nebulae that appear as dark nenbule in the optical, can shine brightly in the infrared due to blackbody radiation from the warm dust

    Interstellar dust grains are complex in shape (left)
        We don't know what they are made up of (when we look at the spectra, heavy elements are missing)
        generally the dust grains are elongated
        Light that passes through them are polarized
        for some reason they are all alinged in the same orientation
            thought to be because the milky way galaxy has its own magnetic field
            the particles become magnitized and are alinged

What happens to the visible light when it passes through interstellar dust
    Dimmed and reddened
