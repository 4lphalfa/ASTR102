Basic statements about the Universe that you might not have thought about
    - The Universe is finite
    - We have seen the edge of the observable Universe
    - The Universe is mostly empty space
    - The main constituents of the Universe are understood but unknown
    - Most matter is of unknown nature ('dark matter')
    - Radiation ('light') fills the Universe
    - Most energy is in a mysterious form ('dark enerty')
    - Most atoms that make up our bodies were manufactured in stars
    - Galaxies are basically 'empty'

Galaxies are basically 'empty'
If you were to pick a spot at random in a galaxy, how often would you land in a star?
        one in 10^23

Our place in Space
    - A galaxy like our Milky Way is about 100000 light years across
    - A light year is the distance light would trabel in a year, about 10000 billion km ~10^13 km
    - Another unit of distance commonly used in Astronomy is the "parsec" which is about 3.3 light years. (206265 AU)
        (AU: Average distane between the Earth and the Sun)

Scientific Theory and the Scientific Method
Astronomy is a Science
    Scientific Knowledge
        - The difference between "explanation" and "understanding"
        - A scientist should be able to "predict the future" through models
    Scientific Theories:
        - Must be testable
        - Must be continually tested
        - Should be simple
        - Should be elegant
    Scientific theories can be proven wrong, but they can never be proven right with 100 percent certainty.

Scientific Theory and the Scientific Method
    - Observation leads to theory explaining it.
    - Theory leads to predicitons consistent with previous observations
    - Predictions of new phenomena are observed. If the observations agree with the prediction, more predictions can be made. If not, a new theory should be made.

The "Obvious" View
    Simplest observation: 
        Look at the night sky
        About 3000 stars visible at any one time; distributed randomly but human brains tends to find patterns
    Groups stars into constellations:
        Figures having meaning to those doing the grouping
    Useful:
        Polaris, which is almost due north
    Useless:
        Astrology, which makes predictions about individuals based on the star patterns at their birth
    Stars that appear close in the sky may not actually be close in space
    The Celestial sphere:
        Stars seem to be on the inner surface of a sphere surrounding the Earth
        They aren't, but can use two-dimentional spherical coordinates (similar to latitude and longitude) to locate sky objects

Angular Measures
    - full circle contains 360 degrees
    - Each degree contains 60' (arc-minuted)
        * full moon/sun subtend half a degree on the sky, or ~30 arc-minutes
    - Each arc-minute contains 60" (arc-seconds)
    - Angular size of an object...

Daily motion of Stars
    All stars appear to trace "circles" on the sky, completing one per day

Earth's Orbital Motion
    - daily cicyle, noon to noon, is diurnal motion - solar day
    - Stars aren't in quite the same place 24 hours later, though, due to Earth's rotation around Sun; when they are once again in the same place, one sidereal day has passed.

1.4 Earth's Orbital Motion
Seasonal changes to night sky are due to Earth's motion around the Sun





==========
2018-09-10
==========

Sidereal Day (23h 56min) - One rotation relative to the stars 
Solar Day (24h) - One rotation relative to the sun

Earth's Orbital Motion
    12 constellations Sun move through during the year are called the zodiac; the path is call the "Ecliptic"
    - Ecliptic is pane of Earth's path around SUN; at 23.5 degrees to celestial equator
    - Northernmost point of path (above celestial equator) is summer solstice; southernmost is winter solstice; points where path crosses celestial equator are vernal and automnal equinoxes
    - Combination of day length and sunlingt angle gives seasons
    - Time from one vernal equinox to next is tropical year
    Precession: rotation of earth's axis itself; makes one complete circle in about 26000 years
    Time for Earth to orbitonce around Sun, relative to fixed stars, is sidereal year
    Tropical year follows seasons; sidereal year follows constellations - in 13000 years July and August will still be summer, but Orion will be a summer constellation
    Tropical year is 20 min shorter than the sidereal year.

1.5 Motion of the Moon
    Moon takes about 29.5 days to go through whole cycle of phases - synodic month
    Phases are due to different amounts of sunlit portion being visible from Earth
    Time to make full 360 degree rotation around Earth, sidereal month, is about 2 days shorter due to motion around sun.
    Eclipses occur when Earth, Moon, and Sun form a straight line
    Lunar Eclipse:
        - Earth is between Moon and Sun
        - Partial when only part of Moon is in shadow
        - Total when it all is in shadow
    Solar Eclipse:
        - Moon is between earth and sun
        - Partial when only part of sun is blocked
        - Total when it all is blocked
        - Annular when Moon is too far from Earth for total
    Eclipses don't occur every month because Earth's and Moon's orbits are not in the same plane

The Measurement of Distance
    Triangulation: Measure baseline and angles, can calculate distance
    Parallax: Similar to triangluation, but look at apparent motion of object against distance background from two vantage points
    Measuring Earth's Radius: done by Eratosthenes about 2300 years ago; noticed that when Sun was directly overhead in one city, it was at an agnle in another
    Measuring that angle and the distance between the cities gives the radius

GAIA Spacecraft currently mapping Milky Way Galaxy
    - GAIA will map 3D positions over 1 billion stars
    - This represents only 1% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy
   


Ch2 The Copernican Revolution

Ancient Calenders
    - Across Europe, many stone structures were built to mark astronomical events

Babylonian Astronomy
    The Babyonians had complex mathematical models to describe the motions of the Moon and other planets.
    Their clay tablets provide us with the earliest written astronomical obesrvations, dating from around 1200 BC
    Western astronomy is directly desendent from Babylonian astronomy.

Ancient Astronomy
    Spokes of the Big Horn Medicine Wheel (WY, USA) are aligned with 
    This temple at Caracol, in Mexico, has many windows that are aligned with astronomical events

Mayan Astronomy: Dresden Codex - approx 1200 AD

Timeline
    Aristotle/Plato 400 BC
    Ptolemy 100 AD
    Gutenberg 1439 AD
    Luther 1517 AD
    Copernicus 1473-1543 AD
    G. Bruno 1548-1600 AD
    Galileo 1564-1642 AD
    Kepler 1571-1630
    Newton 1642-1727 AD

The Geocentric Universe
    Ancient astronomers observed the Sun, the Moon,...
    Planets ("Wanderers"):
        - Move with respect to fixed stars
        - Changed in brightness
        - Change speed
        - Undergo retrograde motion relative to fixed stars
    Inferior Planets: Mercury, Venus
    Superiro Planets: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
    Now know: 
        inferior planets have orbits closer to Sun than Earth's 
        Superiro planets' orbits are farther away
    Early observations:
        - inferiro planets never too far from Sun
        - Superior planets not tied to Sun; exhibit retrograde motion
        - ...

    Earliest modesl had Earth at center of solar system
    Needed lots of complications to accurately track planetary motions
    Planetary motions were one of the premier...
    
    Ptolemy's Complicated Cosmological System
        Each planet orbits around a small circle called an epicycle. 
        Each epicycle orbits on a larger circle called the deferent. 
        This system is not centerd exactly on Earth but on an offset point called the equant.

Geocentric Universe
    Hard to explain the retrograde motion of planets, used a concept called epicycles

Ptolemy's Complicated Cosmological System

Arabic Astromony
    Still based on the geocentric model
    Much of the terminology comes from Arabic astronomers

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543)
    Rediscovered the writings are Aristarcas
    The sun is the center

Copernicus' Model
    Predicted retrograde model
    Still relied on circles

Heliocentric vs Geocentric models
    They are mathematically equivilent

The Heliocentric Model of the solar system
    Explains what's happening with retrograde motion

The Foundations of the Copernican Revolution
    Earth is at the center of the moon's orbit
    All planets revolve around the sun
    The stars are far away because there is no observed paralax
    Motion of stars is because of the earth's rotation
    Earth is not the center of everything

Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)
    First astronmer to use telescopes 
    NOT the first to invent them
    Disovered evidence the contridict the geocentric model

    The birth of modern astronomy
        Looked at the Milky Way and saw it was made of many stars
        Discovered that the moon has mountains and valleys
        Observed the sun had sunspots and that it rotates, 1 month rotation
        Saw that Jupiter has moons
        Venus has phases
            The geocentric model can not explain this

Aristotle's view
    Based on meditation and thought
    Rest is the 'natural' state of matter

The New Science: Galileo's view
    Set up a physics lab

Inertia
    Experiments with pendulums
    Weight and speed of freefall

Planetary Motions
    Arrogant, made fun of people who didn't believe in the heliocentric model

Galileo's Trial
    Galileo was tried and convicted of heracy by the Roman Inquisition

The Heliocentric Universe
    Inferior planets: Mercury, Venus
    Superior planets: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn

The Laws of Planetary Motion
    Kepler's laws were derived using observations made by Tycho Brahe
    Tycho made very precice observations on Mars

Conic Sections
    Intersection of a plane with a cone

Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
    Planetary orbits are ellipses, SUn at one focus
    Imaginary line connecting Sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times (Closer to the sun means faster, further means slower)
    Square of period of planet's orbital motion is proportional to cube of semimajor axis (a^3 = p^2, a is distance, p is period)
    
Some properties of Planetary Orbits
    
Newton's Laws of motion
    An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object moving in a straight line at constant speed will not change its motion, unless and external force acts on it
    When a force is exerted on an object, its acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass: a = F/m
    When object A xerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A

Newton's Laws of gravity
    On the earth's surface, acceleration of gravity is approximately constant, and directed towards the center of earth
    For two massive objects, gravitational force is proportional to the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them
    The constant G is called the gravitational constant; it is measured experimentally and found to be  G = 6.67x10^-11
        F = GM1M2/r^2

Newtonian Mechanics
    The planets also exert a force on the sun
    This means that the sun moves as well ever so slightly
    Escape velocity: how fast something has to go to escape the earth's gravity

Einstein's Theory of General Relativity
    Gravity doesn't produce a force, but instead it curves/warps space time, resulting in an acceleration towards the centre of gravity
    
Proof of Einstein's Theories
    Gravity is due to a curvature of space-time
    When mass is introduced, space-time is warped
        Star light bends around the sun due to its mass warping space

Gravitational Lensing
    Light is bent by an intermediate galaxy to observe a galaxy that should not be seeable

Chapter 3: Radiation

Electromagnetic Radiation:
    ex. Light
    Light moves through the vacum of space

Waves in water
    Waves are a way of transmitting energy without transporting them along
    The particles are just moving up and down

Waves
    Wave Motion: Transmits energy without the physical trasport of material

Wave Properties
    Frequency: # of wave crests that pass a given point per second
    Period: Time between passage of sucessive crests
        Period = 1/Frequency
    Wavelength: Distance between sucessive crests
    Velocity: Speed at which crests move
        Velocity = Wavelength/Period

Waves in what?
    Most waves travel in a medium
    Light is an electromagnetic wave
    Change in electromagnetic field causes the waves

Electromagnetic waves:
    Oscillating electric and magnetic fields, Changing electric field creates magnetic field and vice versa

What's it traveling through
    The vacum of space
    The fabric of space time also contains electromagnetic fields and can have positive or negative fields

Speed of light:
    c = 299792458 m/s
    Sun to Earth: 8.32 min
    Andromeda Galaxy to Earth: 2.5 Million Years
        Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 Million light years away

Info from the Skies
    Visible Spectrum
    Skin can detect infared radiation
    
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
    No limit of wavelengths
    Different ranges have different names

The Wave Nature of Radiation
    Diffraction is purely a wave phenomenon.

Interference
    Is also a wave phenomenon
    Crests and troughs can add up to nothing
    "Double Slit Experiment"
    Constructive and Destructive interference

Thermal Radiation
Blackbody spectrum
    
The Kelvin Temperature Scale
    Water freezes at 273 K, boils at 373 K
    O K - All thermal motion stops

Thermal Radiation
    Radiation Laws
        1. Peak wavelength is inverseley proportional to temperature (frequency is directly proportional to temperature
        2. Total energy emitted is proportional to fourth power of temperature (note heavier curves)
        
More about the Radiation Laws
    Wien's Law: if we measure T in kelvin and lambda in mm, we find for the peak wavelength: lambda_max - 2.9 mm/T

The Echo of the Big Bang
    
The Perfect Black Body

Wien's law means that hotter stars produce much more high-frequency light

The Doppler Effect
    If one is moving toward a source of radiation, the wavelengths seems shorter; if moving aay, they seem lighter
    Depends only on the relative motion of source and observer
    Relationship between frequency and speed:
        Apparent Wavelength / True Wavelength = True Frequency / Apparent Frequency
                                              = 1 + Recession Velocity / Wave Speed

Measuing Velocities with the Doppler effect

Spectroscopy

Refraction of Light
    Refraction: light travels through different materials at different speeds
    Fermat's Principle: Light slows down in water and changes path to minimize the time it takes to reach a particular point
    Prism: Blue light 'bends more' than red light

Gravitational Lenzing
    Fermat's Principle: Gravity may produce multiple images of distant stars

Spectral Lines
    Spectroscope: Splits light into component colours
    Emmission lines: Single frequencies emitted by partucular atoms
    "The fingerprint of an atom"
    Emission spectrum can be used to identify elements

Absorption Spectrum
    If a continuous spectrum passes through a cool gas, atoms of the gas will absorb the same frequencies they emit
    The cool gas absorbs some of the light and create dark lines, gives the signature of the atom

Spectral Lines
    An absorbtion spectrum can also be used to identify elements. 
    Absorption is inverse of Emission

Kirchhoff's Laws
    1. Luminous solid, liquid, or dense gas produces continuous spectrum (essentially a "black boody")
    2. Low-density hot gas produces emission spectrum
    3. Continuous spectrum incident on cool, thin gas prduces absorption spectrum

Atoms and Radiation
    Existense of spectral lines required new model of atom, so that only certain amounts ("quanta") of energy could be emitted or absorbed
    Bohr model had certain allowed orbits for electron in the hydrogen atom

The Hydrogen Aom
    Energy levels of the hydrogen aton, showing tow series of emission lines:
        The energies of the electron in each orbit are given by: E_n = 13.6(1-1/n^2)eV
        The emission lines corresponding to the energy differences 
        eV = electron-Volt (a unit of energy)

The Photoelectric Effect
    Photoelectric effect can only be understood if light behaves like particles
    The Photoelectric Effect:
        When light shines on metal, electrons can be emitted
        Frequency must be higher than minimum, characteristic of material
        Increaed frequency -- more energetic electrons
        Increased intensity -- more electrons, same energy

Atoms and Radiation
    Light particles ("Photons") each have energy E
    ...

Wave-Particle Duality
    If light is made of 'particles' how can effects like diffraction or interference coour? Thie is one ot the conundrums addressed by Quantum Mechanics
    'Particles' follow 'paths' with different probabilities. Luminous fringes form where probabilities are highter, dark fringes where probabilitieis are lowest

De Broglie Wavelengths
    Actually, all particles may be thought of as being 'waves'. The wavelength depends on the 'momentum (p)' of a particle (usually,, its mass times its velocity). 
    For an electron, its wavelengths is about the size of it's orbit around the atom
    Electrons occilate around the neucleus, but can be out of sync with each other

Formation of Spectral Lines
    Absorption can boost an electron to the second (or higher) execited state
    Absorption spectrum: Created when atoms absorb photons of right energy for excitation
    Multielectron atoms: Much more complicated spectra, many more possible states
    Ionization changes energy levels
    Emission lines can be used to identify atoms

Modern Spectrographs
    

Telescopes

Planar Waves
    Light recieved from a very distant object behaves like "planar waves"
    These may also be represented by parallel "rays" 

Lenses and Telescope
    A simple telescope is a refracting lense
    Recall Fermat's Principle. Rays follow paths that minimize the time it takes to reach the focus.

Optical Telescopes
    Images can be formed through reflection or refraction
    A reflecting (parabolic) mirror may be used as a telescope
    The parabolic shape is critical. A spherical mirror is not able to produce images
    The Hubble Spaec Telescope (HST) provides a sobering example
        Mirror was shaped incorrectly
    Reflecting and refracting telescopes
    Telescopes are "light buckets" used to gather as much light as possible
    Modern telescopes are all reflectors. Why?
        Light traveling through lens is refracted differently depending on wavelength
        SOme light traveling through lens is absorbed
        Large lens can be bery heave, and can only be supported at edge
        A lens needs two optically acceptable surfaces; mirror needs only one

Refracting Telescopes (lenses)
    Yerkes Observator has a 40" diamater lense, the largest in the world. It was built in 1890 and is still used today

Reflecting Telescopes (mirrors)
    The Keck telescope, a 10m-diameter optical telescope sited as the summit of Mauna Kea
    Keck uses a segmented mirror in order to improve its shape control and to accommondate it to atmospheric fluctuations

Kirchhoff's laws
    In the absorption spectrum, emission lines are still there but are so faint that they look dark
    
Optical Telescopes

Chromatic Aberration
    can be resolved for two colours simultaneously, but not for three

Optical Telescopes
    The Hubble Soace Telescope has a variety of detectors:
        Ultraviolet
        Infrared
    The Hubble Space Telescope's main mirror is 2.4m in diameter and is designed for visible, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation

Telescope Size
    Light Gathering Power: Improves detail by allowing fainter features to be observed
    Brightness of an image proportional to square of radius of mirror. A 5m telescope observe and object 25x faster than a 1m telescope

Diffraction limit
    The wavelength of light and the telescope size determine the resolution power of a telescope
    Diffraction limits the resolution of radio telescopes
    Larger wavelengths causes more diffraction

Telescope Size
    Resolving power: when better can distinguish objects better...

The Largest telescopes on earth
    Mauna Kea in Hawaii
        Gemini-north
        Canada-France-Hawaii
        Keck 1&2
        Subaru
    The Gran TeCan(10.4m) - La Palma
    ESO VLT - Paranel, Chile 
    Magic Telescopes - Largest gamma ray telescopes - 17m

Images and Detectors
    Image acquisition: charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are electronic devices, which can be quickly read out and reset
    Image processing by computers can sharpen images

Atmospheric Effect
    Atmospheric bluring is due to air movements (Turbulence")
    This is why stars 'twinkle' -- limits the resolution of ground based optical telescopes
        "Seeing" - Atmospheric turbulance (Lower is better)

High Resolution Astronomy 
    Solutions:
        Put telescopes on mountaintops, especially in deserts
        Put telescopes in space
    Adaptie optics: control mirrors based on temperature and orientation

Adaptive optics
    Distorted wavefronts are reflected by an adaptive distorting mirror
    Some of the wavefronts are sent to a sensor to analyze the distortion
    This sensor configures the adaptive distorting mirror in real time

High Resolution Astronomy
    Adaptive optics: track atmospheric changes with laser; adjust mirrors in real time

Active optics
    the mirror's own weight will cause it to deform. The telescope will correct for this once it is in a set position.

Radio Astronomy
    Radio telescopes
        similar to optical reflecting telescopes
        Radio wavelengths are about a million times longer than visible light
        Less sensitive to imperfections (due to longer wavelengths); can be made very large
    Largest radio telescop eis the 300m dish at Arecibo, Puerto Rico
    Lower wavelength means poor angular resolution
    Advantages of radio astronomy
        can oberve 24 hours a day
        can observe through clouds, rain, etc
        observes at a completely different frequency; different info

Diffraction limit
    The wavelength of light and the telescope size determine the resolution power of a telescope
    Diffraction limits the resolution of radio telescopes
    
Interferometry
    Combines info from several widely spread radio telescopes as if it came from a single dish
    Resolution will be that of dish whose diameter = largest separation between dishes
    Can get radio images whose resolution is close to optical
    Interferometry can also be done with visible light, but is much more difficult due to shorter wavelengths
    
The ALMA Array
    Resolution can be improved with 'arrays of telescopes"
    The ALMA Array is a set of 66 radiotelescopes located in norther Chile, which detect radiation with wavelengths between 0.3mm and 10mm
    The antennas are mobile

Resolution is worse with long-wave light, so radio telescopes must be large to compensate

Space Based Astronomy
    Ground based observations in the far infrared, microwave, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma ray bands is difficulty or virtually impossible because the atmosphere absorbs much of the radiation
    These observations are carried out from either stratospheric ballons or satellites
    Ultraviolet observing must be done is space, as the atmosphere absorbes almost all ultraviolet rays
    X-rays and gamma rays will not reflect off mirrors as other wavelengths do; need new techniques
    X-rays will reflect at a very shallow angle and can therefore be focused

Ch 16 The Sun
The Source of essentially all energy sources on the Earth

"A star like many others..."
    Understanding the sund means understanding also other stars
    Laws of Physics are the same in other parts of the universe
    We are not "priviledged observers"
    There must be physical reason for why the Sun is the way it is
Our Sun is a red/white

The Astronomical Unit
    Average distance between the Earth and the Sun

The Habitable Zone

The Scales of the Solar System
    The Sun is aprox 109 Earth diameters, 300x the Earth's mass

Physical Properties of the Sun
    Radius: 700000 km
        Trig may be used to infer it from the Sun's apparent size and it's distance to Earth
        Sun's distance to earth may be inferred from Moon's Distance and radius since they have similar angular size
        Moon's distance may be measured through parallax (2 observers measure position at the same time)
    Mass: 20x10^30 kg
        Derived from Newton's laws; uses the orbital period of earth and the distance sun-earth
        the force keeping the Earth in orbit is the gravity of the Sun (G is Newton's gravitational constant
            M = rv^2/G
    Density: 1400 kg/m^3
    roation: Differential, period about a month
        Equator rotates quicker than the poles
    Surface temp:
        Apparent surface is called 'photosphere'

Sunspots
    Sun's rotation may be measured tracking 'sunspots'. These are dark spots caused by magnetic storms on the Sun's 'photosphere'
    
Physical Properties of the Sun
    Luminosity: Total energy radiated by the Sun -- can be calculated from the fraction of that energy that reaches Earth
    Solar Constant: amount of Sun's energy reaching Earth -- is 1400 W/m^2
    Total lumonosity is about 4x10^26 W -- the equivalent of 10 billion 1-megaton nuclear bombs per second

Physical Properties of the Sun: the Solar Constant

The Solar Interior: What keeps the sun in equilibrium
    Mathmatical models, consistent with observations and physical principles, provide information about the Sun's interior
    ...

The Solar Interior
    Doppler shifts of solar spectral lines indicate a complex pattern of vibrations. The Sun "boils"
    This may be used to construct a "sonogram" of the Sun. 

Physical Properties of the Sun
    Interior structure of the Sun:
        Core
            nuclear fusion takes place here
        Radiation Zone
            transparent to radiation
        Convection Zone
        Photosphere
            dense enough to produce black body spectrum, but low enough density so that energy can escpae
        Chromosphere
            lower atmosphere of the Sun
        Transition Zone
            transitions from lower temp to higher temp
        Carona

The Solar Interior
    Solar density and temperature, according to the standard solar model
    Energy Transport:
        The radiation zone is relatively transparent; the cooler convection zone is opaque
        Photons are constantly being absorbed and then re-emitted
        Can take from a thousand to a million years to escape

The Sun's Atmosphere
    Spectral analysis can tell us what elements are present, but only in the chromosphere and photosphere of the Sun. This spectrum has lines from 67 different elements.
    These lines are produced by cool, low-density gas "clouds" on top of the Sun's "surface" -- the photosphere

The Composition of our Sun
    Mostly hydrogen and helium
    Elements like iron have very strong absorption lines
    Hydrogen and helium do not have strong absorption lines

Cecilia Helena Payne Gaposchkin (1900-1979)
    Temperature and pressure affects the strength of the spectral lines
    Contrubuted to the discovery of the makeup of the Sun and other stars

The Sun's Atmosphere
    The cooler chromosphere is above the photosphere
    Difficult to see directly, as photosphere is too bright, unless moon covers photosphere and not chromosphere during eclipse.
    Small solar storms in chromosphere emit spicules

The Sun's Atmosphere
    Solar corona can be seen during eclipse if both photosphere and chromosphere are blocked
    Corona is much hotter than layers below it -- must have a heat source, probably electromagnetic interactions

Solar Magnetism
    Sunspots: Appear dark because slightly cooler than surroundings (by about 1000 degrees)
    Sunspots come and go, typically in a few days
    Sunspots are linked by pairs of magnetic field lines
    Sunspots originate when magnetic field lines are distorted by Sun's differential rotation
        Every 11 years, the magnetic fields flip, 22 years for a full rotation
        The uneven spin of the Sun distorts the magnetic field
        If a loop occurs near the edge of teh sun, we see it as a prominence
        Which hemisphere affects the direction traveled of the magnetic field
    The SUn has an 11-year sunspot cycle, during which sunspot numbers rise, fall, and then rise again

The Active Sun
    Areas around sunspots are active; large eruptions may occur in photosphere
    Solar prominence is large sheet of ejected gas
    Solar flare is a large explosion of Sun's surface, emitting a similar amount of energy to a prominence, but in seconds or minutes rather than days or weeks
    Coronal mass ejection occurs when a large "bubble" detaches from the sun and escapes into space

Solar Wind
    High above the photosphere, charged particles (electrons, protons, helium nuclei) escape the sun
    The sun's upper atmosphere is constantly evaporating and being replenished
    Every second, 2 million tonnes of matter are carried away by winds
    The sun has been doing this for 4.6 billion(?) years

What is responsible for the corona's higher temperatures far from the surface
    The suns' magnetic field acts like a pump and sends particles up

The Heart of the SUn
    Given the sun's mass and energy production, we find that, on the average, every kilogram of the sun produces about 0.2 milliwatts of energy
    This is not much ....
    ....
    Nuclear fusion is the energy source for the Sun
    In general, muclear fusion works like this:
        nucleus 1 + nucleus 2 -> nucleus 3 + energy
    But where does the energy come from?
    It comes from the mass; if you add up the masses of the inital nuclei, you will find the result is more than the mass of the final nucleus
    The relationship between ....
    ....
    Nuclear fusion requires that like-charged nuclei get close enough to each other to fuse. 
    But like chages repel each other
    This can happen only if the temperature is extremely high -- over 10 millin K

The Colour of the sun (Lym colour effect)
    When we look into the photosphere, the deeper we go the hotter it is
    When we look at the edge, we see more of the cooler photosphere


The Heart of the Sun
    Nuclear fusion is the energy source for the sun
        Fuses hydrogen into helium, reduced mass becomes energy
    Requires that like-charged particles get close enough to fuse
    But like charges repel each others
    This can happen only if the temperature is extremely high -- over 10 million K
    This is called the strong force
    The image depicts proton-proton fusion. In this reaction:
        proton + proton -> deuteron + positron + neutrino
    The positron is just like the electron except positively charged: the neutrino is also related to the electron but has no charge and very little, if any, mass
    In more conventional notation
        1H + 1H -> 2H + positron + neutrino
    This is the first step in a three-step fusion process that powers most stars: The P-P Chain
        4 protons fuse to make Helium-4
    The ultimate result of the process:
        4(^1H) -> ^4He + energy + 2 neutrinos
    The helium stays in the core
    The energy is in the form of gamma rays, which gradually lose their energy as they travel out from the core, emerging as visible light
    The neutrinos escape without interacting
    The energy created in the whole reaction can be calculated by the difference in mass between the initial particles and the final ones -- for each interaction it turns out to be 4.3x10...

Neutrinos
    Neutrios are tiny, almost massless, neutral particles produced by nuclear fusion
    They travel near the speed of light and barely ever interact with anything! (They can travel through a light year of lead and not interact with any atoms)

Observations of solar neutrios
    Neutrinos are emitted directly from the core of the Sun and escape, interacting with virtually nothing. 
        Being able to observe these neutrinos would give us a direct picutre of what is happening in the core
    Unfortunately, they are no more likely to interact with earth-based detectors than they are with the Sun; 
        the only way to spot them is to have a huge detector volume and to be able to observe single interaction events
    Typical solar neutrino detector resolution is very poor
    Detection of solar neutrinos has always been a deficit in the type of neutrinos expected to be emitted by the sun
    Recent research...

How long do protons take to escape the sun
    hundreds of thousands to millions of years


Ch17 Measuring the Stars
    
The Solar Neighbourhood
    To decide which stars are intrinsicall brighter we nned to measure their distances.
    Remember parallax?
        The closer the object, the greater the parallax shift
    Triangulation
    Parallax
        Half the angle shift is the parallax angle

GAIA Spacecraft currently mapping Milky Way galaxy
    GAIA will map 3d positions over 1 billion stars
    This represents only 1% of the stars in the Milky Way

Arcseconds and Parsecs
    1 Degree = 3600 arcseconds = 3600" (like one hour is 3600 seconds)
    60 arcseconds = 1 arcminute = 1'
    1 parsec (pc) is the distance of a star if its measured parallax angle is exactly one arcsecond (about 3.3 light years)
    ...

The Solar Neighbourhood
    Nearest star to the Sun: Proxima Centauri, which is a member of the three-star system Alpha Centauri complex
    To get an idea: if Sun is a marble, Earth is a grain of sand orbiting 1 m away, the nearest star is another marble 270 km away
    Solar system extends about 50 m from Sun; rest of distance to nearest star is basically empty

Oort cloud, edge of our solar system

Stellar Proper Motions
    Some stars may also move relative to other fixed objects on the sky: this is called proper motion
    Barnard's star has the largest proper motion of any star -- proper motion is the actual shift of the star in the sky, after correcting for parallax

Actual Motion of the Alpha centauri complex
    Radical velocities are measured from the Doppler shift of spectral lines
    Tangential velocities are inferred from the star's distance and proper motion

Stellar Paralax can be used to measure the distance of stars
A star's real space motion combines its apparent proper motion with its radial motion toward or away from earth
    A star's proper motion is the annual apparent motion across the sky

Luminosity and Apparent Brightness
    Luminosity is a measure of the total power (energy per unit time) radiated by a star
    Apparent brightness is how bright a star appears when biewed from earth: it depends on the absolute brightness but also on the distance of the star. It is a measure of 'energy flux'
    * Luminosity passing through each spear is the same
    * Area of sphere: 4(pi)r^2
    * Divide luminosity by are subtended by telescope to get brightness
    (Light obeys the inverse square law)
    If we know a star's apparent brightness and its distance...

Aparent Magnitudes
    The magnitude scale is the system we use to describe how bright a given objects is 
    Hipparchus came p with this system completely by eye
    He rated stars on a scale from 1-6
    1 = bright, 6 = faint
    (but now we use all real numbers)
    A difference of 5 magnitudes (1 to 6) corresponds to a factor of 100 change in brightness
    So an object of magnitude 1 is 100 time brighter than a magnitude 6...
    ...

Apparent Magnitude - examples
    A star of magnitude 1 is 2.51 times brighter than a star of magnitude 2
    A star of magnitude 2 is 2.51 times brighter than a star of magnitude 3...
    Verify: Magnitude 6 to magnitude 1 = factor of 100 brightness
        2.51^ = 100
    ...

Aboslute Magnitudes
    The Absolute Magnitude is the magnitude an object would have if the object was 10pc away (33 light years)
    The absolute magnitude puts objects at an equal distance so we can compare their actual brightnesses (Luminisoty)
    We only use the absolute magnitude to compare objects to one another

Magnitude Scales
    Apparent luminosity/brightness is measured by astronomers using a magnitude scale, which is related to our perception
    It is a logarithmic scale; a change of 5 in magnitude corresponds to a change of a factor of 100 in apparent brightness
    It is also inverted -- larger magnitudes are dimmer

Magnitude Summary
    Apparent magnitude is the brightness of the star as seen from earth
    Absolute magnitude is the brightness a star would have a distance of 10 parsecs
    ....

        Absolute is the brightness a star would have at a distance of 10 parsecs
            Measure intrinsic brightness or luminosity

Magnitude to Luminosity conversion
    Converting from magnitude to luminosity in solar units: this graph allows us to perform this conversion simply by readiong horizontally. 
    A reduction of 5 in magnitude corresponds to an increase in a factor of 100 in luminosity, as it should.

Stellar Temperatures
    The color of a star is indicative of its temperature.
    Red stars are relatively cool, where as blue ones are hotter.
    Why?
        Hotter is shorter wavelength, cooler is longer
    The radiation from stars is blackbody radiation.
    The blackbody curve is not symmetric
    Observantions at two wavelengths are enough to define the temperature
        Only need 2 measurements
        Tells us about the temperature of the object
    Stellar spectra are much more informative tha the blackbody curves
    There are seven general categories of stellar spectra, corresponding to different temperatures
    From highest to lowest, those categories are
        O B A F G K M

Stellar Sizes
    A very few large, very close stars can ve imaged directly using speckle interferometry.
    Stellar radii vary widely
    Stars come in many different sizes: dwarfs, subgiants, supergiants, etc
    For the vast majority of stars that cannot be imaged directly, size must be inferred from their luminosity and temperature

Estimating Stellar Radii

The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram
    distinctly see there are populations of stars
    What can one do with luminosities and temperatures?
    The H-R diagram plots stellar luminosity agaisnt surface temperature
    Once many stars are plotted on an H-R diagram, a pattern begins to form
    The darkened curve is called the main sequence, as this is where most stars are
    Also indicated is the white dwarf region: these stars are hot but not bery luminous
    Two other categories, red giants and the blue giants
    Clearly, the brightest stars in the sky appear bright because of their enoumous ...
    About 90% of stars lie on the main sequence; 9% are red giants and 1% are white dwarfs
    But why do stars distribute themselves this way...

H-R plots stars based off of luminosity and temperature (brightness and colour)

Extending the Cosmic Distance Scale
    Spectroscopic Paralax: Has nothing to do with parallax, but does use spectroscopy in finding the distance to a star
    1. Measure the star's apparent magnitude and spectral class
    2. Use spectral class to estimate luminosity
    3. Apply inverse-square law to find distance
    Spectroscopic parallax can extend the cosmic distance scales to several thousand parsecs
        More theoretical, not nearly as precise (10-20% accurate)
    The spectroscopic parallax calculation can be misleading if the star is not on the main sequence. The width of spectral lines could be used to define luminosity classes.
    in this way, giants and supergiants can ve distinguished from main-sequence stars

Stellar Masses
    Determining of stellar masses:
        Many stars are in binary pairs; measurement of their orbital motion allows determination of the masses of the stars
        Visual binaries can be measured directly
    Spectroscopic binaries can be measured using their Doppler shifts
    Finally, eclipsing binaries can be measured using the changes in luminosity. This is the same as one of the methods used to discover extrasolar planets
    Mass is the main determinant of where a star will be on the main sequence
        Higher luminosity = higher mass = higher temp (For stars on the main sequence)

Stellar Lifetimes
    Mass is also related to stellar lifetime
        the higher the mass, die very quickly
    So the most massive stars habe the shortest lifetime -- they have a lot of fuel, but burn it very quickly

Ch18 The Interstellar Medium

The Interstellar Medium
    Interstellar gas cloud (nebula) visible to the naked eye: the Orion Nebula
    A wide-angle view of the Milky Way -- the dark regions are dust clouds, blocking light from the stars beyond

    The interstellar medium consists of gas and dust
    Gas is atoms and small molecules, mostly hydrogen and helium
    Dust is more like soot or smoke; arger clumps of particles
    Dust absorbs light, and reddens light that gets through
    Reddening can interfere with blackbody temperature measurement, but spectral likes do not shift
    
Light Absorbtion
    This image illustrates how reddening works. On the right, the upper image was made using visible light; the lower wa made using infrared
        the light that goes through the cloud absorbs more light at shorter wavelengts
The Interstellar Medium absorbs light more strongly as shorter wavelengths

Interstellar Matter
    Nebulae that appear as dark nenbule in the optical, can shine brightly in the infrared due to blackbody radiation from the warm dust

    Interstellar dust grains are complex in shape (left)
        We don't know what they are made up of (when we look at the spectra, heavy elements are missing)
        generally the dust grains are elongated
        Light that passes through them are polarized
        for some reason they are all alinged in the same orientation
            thought to be because the milky way galaxy has its own magnetic field
            the particles become magnitized and are alinged

What happens to the visible light when it passes through interstellar dust
    Dimmed and reddened

"Nebula" is a general term used for fuzzy objects in the sky:
    Dark Nebula: Dust Cloud
    Emission Nebula: glows, due to hot stars

Emission Nebulae
    Usually glow red because of the H_(alpha) line
    How nebula work
        Reflections Nebula: reflecting the light of a newborn stars off of a dust cloud

There is a strong interaction between the nebula and the stars within it; the fuzzy areas near the pillars are due to photoevaopatioin (due to solar wind)


Emission Nebulae
    Composed of hydrogen (90%), helium (9%), and other trace elements
    Within the molecular clouds, the trace elements form into dust grains 
    "Forbidden" are emission lines that we cannot see in standard laboratory conditions (best vaccum cannot replicate space)
        A forbidden transition in oxygen is responsible for the gree colour in the Orion Nebula

Dark Dust Clouds
    The are cold (few tens of Kelvins)
    Asorb visible light and emit radio wavelengths
    Light from a star always passes through material before we see it
        This can change the spectra of the star

21-Centimeter Radiation
    When you take a charged particle and move it in a circle, it creates a magnetic field perpendicular to the spin
    Depending on how an electron spins
        The same way with the proton will create more energy
    We can use this to map the distribution of hydrogen in galaxies

Ch19 Star Formation

Star-Forming Regions
    For some reason, thes dust clouds begin to contract under its own gravatational force; as it collapses, the center becomes hotter and hotter until nuclear fusion begins in the core
    The gas has a temperature, and the particles have a pressure
        This is true for interstellar gas
    For a small cloud, it does not have enough pressure to collape
        But for bigger clouds this does happen

Competition in Star Formation
    Rotation can interfere
    Magnetism can interfere
    Can condense in a distorted way

The Formations of Stars like the Sun
    Important to start cold because this means the pressure is low and can collapse
    At 10000000 K stars become powered by nuclear fusion

    Stage 1
        Triggered by some external influence
            Another star goes supernova which compresses the gas
            Stellar winds
        The cloud begins to fragment until you get small individual clumps
            These will be individual stars

    Stage 2
        The cloud will continue to collapse until the cloud pressure is enough to prevent the could from fragmenting further

    Stage 3
        Then the could will collapse itself

    Stage 4
        The protostar will get so dense at the center to start to have a photosphere
        It will become opaigue
        The heat will no longer dissapate and is trapped inside the star, heating up the star's core

    The star will continue to collapse until it reaches an equilibrium state
    As the star is collapsing, it's still waiting to reach equilibrium and eventually gets so hot that nuclear fusion begins

    Stage 6
        The star is born

Stars of other Masses
    Stars that have higher masses means the cloud it was formed from was higher mass
        and the process happens faster

Observations of Clouds Fragments and Protostars
    
Could Collapse and Accretion Disks
    If we have a cloud, it will have some sort of motion
        Conservation of angular motion applies
    When you compress a cloud, it will spin up massively
    When collapsing, it will conserve angular momentum
        A disk will form around the core
    On the poles, there is no angular momentum to conserve, so it will fall into the core
    When the winds get strong enough, it will blow away the disk
        Before this, the disk will focus the winds and force them out of the poles (Bipolar outflows)

Observations of Jets
    
Shockwaves and Star Formations
    These strong winds can cause other star formations
    Other Triggers:
        Death of another star
        Supernova
        Density waves in galatic spiral arms
        Galaxy collisions

Star Clusters
    Stars don't form in isolation
    Clusters are nice for studying because they form at the same time and they are at the same distance
    The differences between open and globular clusters are the globular clusters are very old
    The presense of the really big stars can influence how the others evolve

Eta Carinae
    The upper mass limit of what a star can be
    Produces so much energy that it almost blows itself up





==========

'Burning' fusing elements together

Eta Carinae
    ~150 times the mass of our sun (for the main star)
    ~80 time the mass of our sun (for the smaller star)


Ch20 Stellar Evolution

All stars are formed from a collapsing interstellar cloud

When it gets to the main sequence, it stays stable for a very long time

The bigger the star, the faster it evolves

Burn helium in their core and become red giants

Stars burning in the main sequence burn hydrogen in their core

Hydrogen Fusion
    for stars like our sun, they use the P-P chain
    This process releases gamma ray energy
        the resulting helium ways less than the starting ingredients, the loss of mass was converted into energy

Hydrostatic Equilibrium
    It takes time for the energy to escape from the core
    pressure outwards vs gravity inwards
    Red giants happen because the energy can escape before it reaches equilibrium
    At equilibrium, all the energy comming from the protosphere is equal to the energy coming from the core
        if the energy released is less than the energy coming from the core, the energy is being absorbed somewhere
        What happens when it increases/decreases

Leaving the main sequence
    When large stars run out of fuel, the have a violent death
    When a lower mass star runs out of fuel, there will be an inbalance and puff ut

Everything on earth comes from the higer mass stars

Red Dwarf Stars
    they are all convective
    This means that when hydrogen is fused into helium, it is constantly replenishing their store of hydrogen
        This is why they live a long time
    Because of convection, they use all of their hydrogen
    They are very faint

Heat Transfer of Stars
    <0.5 solar masses are only have convection
    0.5-1.5 are radiation to convection
        the fuel in the core is the only fuel it has
    >1.5 are convection to radiation
        bigger, but still limited fuel supply

Core Evolution of a Sun-like star
    in the beginning of the main sequence mostly hydrogen
    then the hydrogen is turned into helium
    finally at the end of the main sequence, not hydrogen at the core, only helium which expands outwards from the core

Life Track of a Sun-like star
    When the core is only helium, it is not hot enough to fuse helium together
        the nuclear reaction stops and everything collapses
        not outward energy production
        becomes more dense and heats up
            the hydrogen is still burning around an inert core
            the star gets even hotter
                its producing so much energy that the star starts to puff up and cool off
                from main sequence to red giants
                reaches a point where it fuses helium

Core Hydrogen Runs Out
    We then have this helium core (nonburning helium ash)
        this compresses that the particles begin to squish up against each other

Degenerate Cores Broken Thermostat
    No more room left between the particles
    its so compressed but gravity still pushes down on it

Electron Degeneracy
    If you think of electrons like these plastic balls, if you drop something large on them, they will break
    When the core becomes like this, it does not grow
Every electron can be paired with another (phase lock)

Helium Fusion
    When the temperature becomes hot enough, it can fuse and become Be, which can fuse with another He to become Carbon

The Helium Flash
    When the temperature in the core his hot enough for helium fusion
        it starts explosively, and burns through it in minutes
        it can push the particals appart
        transitions to the horizontal branch

Back to the Giant Branch
    transitions to a carbon core, with a helium burning shell, with a hydrogen burning shell
    about to die

Asymptotic Giant Branch
    Does not have enough mass to fuse the carbon, so star becomes unstable
    occilations happen, each time material is shedded away
    gets to a point where it blows itself up
        reaches excape velocity and creates a planetary nebulaa

Planetary Nebula
    The white dwarf stars is the carbon core
        the other layers were blown away
    This is the best case scenario

Planetary Zoo Nebula
    they can have many weird shapes
    the central star is not fusing, but its cooling
        its still hot and produces UV light while cooling down
            ionizes and produces somethning like an emission nebula

White Dwarfs
    around half the mass of the sun at the size of the earth

The Death of a Low Mass Star
    cools and becomes a black dwarf
    fades away
    Turnoff: running out of hydrogen, starting its death sequence

The brightest star Sirius is a binary system
    Its companion is a white dwarf

Evolution of Stars More Massive than the Sun
    Burn helium to form carbon
    Will become a gian and then a white dwarf
    A star around 4 solar masses are still not heavy enough to burn carbon, but it does not become degenerative either
        there is enough energy being produced that the core is still fluid
    Evolution is more horizontal on the H-R diagram
    At a solar mass of 10, it can start fusing carbon

A Different Evoltion
    1x10^8K in their core (to burn helium)  
    6x10^8K in their core (to burn carbon)

    Iron happens to be the most stable configuration for a neucleus
    Iron will require energy to fuse
    When it absorbs energy, there is a catastrophic collapse of the star

The End of a High-Mass Star
    The core becomes the next element
    compresses and heats up and begines the next cycle
    When it reaches Iron, the star will collapse in on itself
        There is so much pressure, it overwhelms the degeneracy pressure, producing a neutron and a neutrino

Supernova Explosion
    Instead of a white dwarf, we end up with a core with pure neutrons
    Get a really dense core that isn't producing any energy
    everything falls in on the core, becomes compressed and rebounds becoming a supernova

2 Kinds of Supernovae
    Type II: What we just described with the iron core
    Type I: Deals with white dwarf stars
        In a binary system, the higher mass star will evolve faster creating a white dwarf
        The smaller star will eventually evolve into a red giant, and will expand out to the 2nd star
        The white dwarf will pull material, eventually fusing the star and blowing itself up

Stellar Evolution in Binary Systems
    Lagrangian Point: where the gravitational forces are equal
    When a star expands into another star's Roche Lobe, the other star can capture the material

Binary Mass Transfer
    the smaller star becomes a blue giant, leaving the other as a red supergiant
    The evolution of is being impacted

Life after Death for White Dwarfs
    If the companion was instead a white dwarf, the white dwarf will be compressed by the transfered material and build up a layer of hydrogen around the white dwarf
        Fusion can be ignited, and explode
        This is called a nova and can happen repeatedly

Repeated Novae
    Everytime it goes through this cycle, it gains a little mass
    Once it reaches a certain size 1.4 solar mass, the star become too massive for solar degeneracy, and the star will blow itself up -> Type I Supernova

Observing Stellar Evolution in Star Clusters
    As the stars are being born, they will heat up and transition to the main sequence
    As the cluster evolves will evolve off the main sequence early on
        Happens so quickly that the low mass stars are still forming
    Lower mass stars start to run out of hydrogen - The main sequence turnoff (Tells us how old the stellar population is)
    As the cluster ages, the lowest mass stars will make it onto the main sequence
    The main sequence turnoff is making its way slowly down the main sequence, red/blue giants are starting to form
    Even ater 10 billion years, low mass stars are still on the main sequence

    Blue stragglers come from merging stars




==========

The star burns hydrogen on the main sequence for most of it's lifetime
When the hydrogen runs out in the core, the star enters a new phase in its life, and the begining of death
A star like the sun will become a red giant, the size of the Earth's orbit, It will eventually die and become a white dwarf

Once the core reaches Iron, it starts to implodes, rebounds, and a supernova is formed


Ch21 Stellar Explosions

Life after Death for White Dwarfs
    A noa is a star that flares up very suddenly and then returns slowly to its former luminosity
    
    most stars have a companion
    If the stars are close enough together, the heavier will go through its lifecycle quicker, turning into a white dwarf
    The smaller star will turn into a red giant
    When it gets bigger than the system's lagrage point, its exterior will be dumped onto the white dwarf
    Once it reaches a certain density, it will explosively fuse all at once expelling its surface, a nova

    Will produce jets coming out of the excretion(?) disk

Novae and Supernovae
    Two totally different phenomenon
        Supernovae are much brighter

    Novae
        Less energy
        occurs multiple times
    Supernovae
        100x brighter
        Can only happen once, it destroys the star

Carbon Detonation
    The white dwarf builds up mass every nova cycle
    When the pressure becomes too much, the electrons will collapse and the neucleii will fuse throughout the star all at once, exploding and destroying a star

A white dwarf that surpasses 1.4 solar masses it causes a Type I Supernova
    1.4 solar mass is the standard

The Chandrasekhar Limit
    The more massive a white dwarf, the smaller it is

Wavelength = h/mv
Wavelength is porportional to 1/mv
If mass goes up, wavelength goes down

proton is 1837x the size of an electron

Supernovae
    Type I: binary star system, useful for measuring distances in the universe because of the consistant mass it happens at
    Type II: Huge star exploding

The End of a High Mass Star
    Iron does not produce energy when it fuses
        Nothing to stop the star from collapsing in on itself
    The evolution of a star accelerates as it gets older
    It starts to implode, and the temperature goes way up
        The blackbody is gamma radiation
        So energetic to split the iron
        all you are left with is protons, electrons
        Core continues to collapse and makes pure neutrons
            as well as a neutrino
        The outer layers now fall into the core
        It rebounds and the layers explode out
            neutrinos add their energy to the rebouning layers making the process more violent

    The density of the core is 10^15 kg/m^3

Supernovae
    Type I: Carbon detination
    Type II: Death of a high mass star

    They have similar peak intensity
    Type I fade a way quite quickly
    Type II stick around longer

Type I and II Supernovae
    Type I: No hydrogen lines in the spectrum (very little from the other star)
    Type II: Hydrogen lines in the spectrum

Depending on the shape of the light curve, we can tell the type of supernova (when combined with the spectra)

Supernova 1006 Remnant
    So bright it was visible during the day
    able to cast shadows at night
    Records of it all over the world
    Now we can observe the remnant
    Can see an expanding shell of material
        can measure how fast it is expanding using redshift

Supernova 1054 Remnant
    Not as bright, but still visible to the naked eye
    The Crab Nebula was created from this

At the centre of the Crab Nebula lies a quickly spinning neutron star, known as a pulsar
The strong magnet fields can accelerate protons and electrons to about half the speed of light

Vela Supernovae
    Exploration shows its exploded 9000 years ago

Supernova 1987A
    Occured in a dwarf galaxy
    Just visible to the unaided eye
    The day before the observation was made, the neutrinos were observed
    It was a blue supergiant before it exploded

Supernova Surveys
    Can be used to help measure distance to other galaxies / our own galaxy
    Sloan Digital Sky Survey

A Neutron Star
    What is left over ant it is about the size of Victoria and more massive than a White Dwarf

Black Holes
    If the original star is massive enough the neutron core can even collapse into a black hole

The Formation of Elements
    During the evolution of a star, we see how elements up to iron are produced
    The more elements that are created in a star, the more possible paths





==========
2018-10-29
==========

The Formation of Elements
    There are 81 stable and 10 radioactive elements that exist on our planet. Where did they come from?
    Where do those 'peaks' on the graph come from
        Helium capture

Beyond Iron
    Creating new elements by building nuclei with different amounts of protons and neutrons is called
    Nucleosynthesis

The Formation of Elements
    Some of these elements are formed during normal stellar fusion. Here, three helium neuclei...
    As fusion progresses in a star, there are different paths that fusion can take
        2 carbon-12 will create Magnesium-24
        But there is a repulsion, so they must overcome this force to fuse together
        carbon-12 + helium-4 fuse together to create oxygen-16  much easier - less repulsion
    Most common is helium fusing with something else

    When stars become very evolved, the core will be made up of heavier elements
    Sometimes the gamma rays are sufficient energy to split neuclei
        As temperature rises, the more energy the gamma rays will have

    In the course of the stars, build of of these elements until iron
    Produces free neutrons to create heavier elements
    Most of the buildup of these heavier elements happens at the end (last seconds) of the star's life

Beyond Iron
    Elements heavier than iron can't be fused inside a star, but they still can be produced (in supernovae)
    Man made elements might exist in supernovae, but they are so unstable that they only exist for seconds before decaying
        However there is no evidence of this, it is only speculated

The cycle of stellar evolution
    a supernova will go out, collide with the interstellar medium initiating a collapse, star to fragments untill fusion can begin to create a star
    This is constantly happening throughout the universe


Ch22 Neutron Stars and Black Holes

Neutron Stars
    Supernova
        Type I: carbon detonation 
            Completely destroys the star
        Type II: High mass star collapse
            Leaves a reminant behind: a neutron star or black hole

High Mass Stellar Remnants: Neutron Stars
    Extremely dense, degenerative
    Have strong gravity, and magnetic fields
    The magnetic field also becomes compressed and intensified
        Most powerful magnetic fields in the universe
    Rotates extremely quickly
        1-1000s of times per second

Neutron Stars
    Magnetic field is rotating extremely fast
        Excelerating charged particles

Pulsars

Jocelyn Bell
    Descovered pulsars

The Lighthouse Effect
    The magnetic fields are so strong, it channels charged particles into the poles, and then responsible for launching particles out of the poles
    Rotational axis and magnetic field is most likely not aligned
        When it is spinning, the hotspot is also spinning
        If we are aligned with the hotspot, it will look like the star is turning on and off, or pulse
    A wind flows out of the equatorial plane, different from the jets
        Creates a disk around the neutron star

Pulsars
    At the center of the crab nebula, we see a pulsar at the center of a disk, as well as jets comming out of the poles and a magnetic field pointed a the earth
    
    We have the rotational axis of the star, and the magnetic field is offset at some angle
    If we are alinged with the beam, we will see flashing as it rotates (Like a lighthouse)
    This pulse is vary narrow
        It tells us that the object emitting this is very small

Neutron Star Binaries
    They can exist in binary systems
    X-ray bursters
        Material will build up on the neutron star, eventually exploding and fading away to repeat the cycle again
        This is emmited in the x-ray part of the spectrum
        Material can also be shot out of the poles of the neutron star, visible in radio
    Whithin the binary system, the material can come in forming an ecreation disk, and slowly spirals into the star
        Within the disk is friction, causing it to lose momentum
        With each impact, it can give the star a little push
        This adds up over time and can speed up the rotation of the star
        This is called milisecond pulsars
        Must exist in a binary system
    Most millisecond pulsars are found in globular clusters
        But these should have faded away long ago, so why do they still exist?

    Sometimes a neutron star can come into a binary systems, capturing one and ejecting the other
        This will cause the neutron star to come alive again, restarting the pulsar
    Millisecond pulsars are at the limit of how fast a neutron star can spin

The first exoplanet discovered was around a pulsar
    The exoplanets rotations caused variations in the pulsar

Gamma Ray Bursts
    Because they were randomly distributed, it was concluded that they were from outside our galaxy
    They also have different light profiles
    The bursts last in the order of seconds
    Eventually we were able to image some of these bursts visually
        These showed that they were happening very far away

    Two Models
        Merging Stars: 
            Neutron stars will slowly spiral into each other, and if they collide they will cause a massive explosion of gamma rays
        Hypernova: 
            The highest mass stars will collapse until they become a black hole, meaining that there is no rebound, creating an accreation disk that punches through the star, 
            the jets puch through the outer atmosphere of the star creating gamma rays
    
    Which model is correct?
        Probably both

Black Holes
    Neutron stars have an upper limit 3-4 solar masses
    What happens if we go beyond?
        Thought to be a black hole
    Nothing can escape from them
    
    When a material collapses beyond the degenerative threshold
    The core of a dead star has collapsed into a single central point of infinite density
        most likely not what actually happens even though the science points to this

Escape velocity
    for a black hole, the escape velocity reaches the speed of light

The Schwartzschild radius
    the radius where the speed of light is the escape radius

Black Hole Misconceptions
    Massive Monsters: Doesn't actually happen, if the sun becomes a black hole, the earth will still rotate around
    Vacuum Cleaners: Only happens when you are extremely close to the black hole

Einstein's Theory of SPecial Relatiavity
    Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light
    No matter how you measure the speed of light, it is always constant






==========

Gamma-Ray Bursts
    Two Models -- Merging neutron stars or a hypernova -- habe been proposed as the source of gamma-ray bursts:

Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity
    Speed of light is constant for all observers
        no matter how fast you are moving
    Space and time have to be linked together
    Flow of time is relative

Space and Time
    'Unified space-time'
    Moving clock (Thought experiment)
    Elevator (Thought experiment)
        in the elevator, you can't tell the difference
        Gravity and accelerations seem to be the same thing

General Relativity
    Instead of having an either, the fabric of space-time can have a geometry
        Things will follow the shortest path
        Gravity is a geometrical effect

    A black hole occurs when the 'indentation' caused by the mass of the hole becomes infinitely deep

Black Hole Tidal Forces
    Far away, the behave like normal objects
    As you come close, you will feel the differential gravitation very strongly

Space Travel Near Black Hole
    Because space and time are one in the same, when it stretches out time moves more slowly
        At the event horizon, time would stop (for us observing)
        For the clock, time goes on as normal
    
    Gravatitional red shifting
    As the light moves away from the black hole, the light waves get stretched out and redded
    When an object leaves the black hole, it needs to expend energ

Inside of Black Holes
    What's inside a black hole
    It will be compressed into a singularity

Observational Evidence for Black Holes
    Cannot be observed directly
        Light will warp around it
    
    Cygnus X-1
        Small sharp signal, small object
        Very massive
        in binary system
  
    Much larger black holes that we can infer
        at the center of the galaxy
        We see stars are orbiting around something, but there is nothing there

Gravitational Waves
    
LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory:
    Laser light source, hits a mirrow and interferes with each other


Ch23 The Milky Way Galaxy

Galaxies
    "Galaxy" from the Greek "galactos" (milk)

Our Parent Galaxy
    Galactic Disk
    Galactic Buldge
        Older stars
    Galactic Center
    
    Andromeda Galaxy is similar
        but twice the size
        Looks eliptical because we are looking at a circle from an angle

The Milky Way's True Nature
    400BC Democratice proposed that it was made up of countless stars
    In 1755 Kant thought that the Milky Way was composed of countless stars, at vast differences
        Depending on how we observe, it can look circluar or elipsoid

Ch23 The Milky Way Galaxy 

The Milky Way's True Nature
    
Measuring the Milky Way
    Made the assumption that all stars have the same brightness
    Counted them
    They were able to make a map of the milky way
    Wasn't accurate, but concluded it was a disk
        Plotted the position of our sun
        Had weird 'fingers' that were created by dust clouds
    Only saw a tiny portion of the milky way galaxy
        vertical component was roughly accurate

The Distance Ladder
    Radar ranging: ~1AU
    Stellar Parallax <200pc
    These cannot be used for distant stars

Stellar Distances
    We can figure out the type of star, and what the brightness should be
    We can then calculate the distance

Stellar Distances to clusters
    Difference i main sequence apparent brightness may be used to infer the relative distances to two clusters

Stellar Distances
    For larger scales, we have to calibrate with clusters closer to us

    Young clusters main sequence will have protostars and hot blue stars
    Older clusters has turnoff, red giants, white dwarfs
    Powerful techniques but...

The Distance Ladder
    Spectroscopic Parallax < ~10000pc

Measuring the Milky way
    Some stars have fixed brightness
    We use variable stars to determine how far away they are based on their brightness
    RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids

    As stars evolve, as they leave the main sequence (hydrostatic equilibrium) and the star doesn't change in size/luminosity
    When they do, it will have its helium flash and will remain on the horizontal branch, in a weird state where they pulsate, 
    they produce a lot of energy and the opacity changes, as the outer atmosphere becomes less dense, puff up, loose energy and shrink, and then continue this cycle
    If we can ID on of these stars as an RR Lyrae
    Any star on the horizontal branch, regartless of mass, have the same luminosity
    We can use these to determine the distance
    
    RR Lyrae and Cepheid have different luminosity curves

Period-luminosity relation
    After analyzing thousands of stars, it was found the Cepheids that have a longer period the greater the luminosity

Measuring the Mikly Way
    RR Lyrae
        Horizontal branch
        Have the same luminosity
    Cepheids
        Have a period-luminosity relationship
        Longer the pulsation, the brighter the star
    Standard Candle: apparent brightness is proportional to Luminosity/(Distance)^2

The Distance Ladder
    Variable Stars: 25Mpc
    they are calibrated using stellar parallax
    build one on top of the other

Globular Clusters
    Star clusters that are very old and dense (millions of stars)

Measuring the Milky Way
    Use RR Lyrae stars to measure distances to globular clusters around our galaxy
    Found out they weren't centered around the sun, but 8kpc away (the galatic center)

    We are half way out of the galaxy (by his maps)
    The globular clusters are distributed all around our galaxy, not just the disk

The Great Debate (1920)
    Shapely - One Camp:
        Our galaxy is so huge that nothing lay beyond it 
    Curtis - Other Camp:
        what they called nebulae were actually other galaxies

The Great Debate (1924)
    Measure Cepheids in the the andromeda galaxy
    Found that it was extremely far away
    Without a doubt, an external galaxy
    Showed that the universe was expanding (Big Bang)

Galactic Structure
    
Galactic Spiral Arms
    Measurement of the position and motion of gas clouds shows that the milky way has a spiral form

Galactic Structure
    Globular clusters exist in a sphirical distribution around our galaxy in random orbits (galactic halo)
        Old stars can also exist in the galactic halo
    The halo is devoid of gas and dust, no material to form new stars, all condensed in the disk
    The Galatic Buldge, lots of old stars, new stars in the center
        Like mini eliptical galaxies

    Halo stars move in any direction
    Stars in the disk moves as a disk
    The Buldge stars move in any direction

Formation of the Milky Way
    Lots of raw (hydrogen, some helium) material that collapse, forming new stars in these gas clouds
    Through gravity, the gas clouds would merge
    When the material came together, it would have a motion it would want to maintain
    As the merged mass spun up, gas and dust falls into the disk, globular clusters and old stars remain
    New stars will form in the disk
    
Galatic Spiral Arms
    Lots of debate about where they come from
    Something needs to enduce them
    When mergers happens between galaxies, tidal forces will create arms
    There is variable rotation between the center and the arms, causing the arms to curl up

    Interactions are thought to create spiral arms
    Why are they persistence?

Density Waves
    (Who really knows?)

The Mass of the Milky Way Galaxy
    Figure out how quickly is our star orbiting around the galaxy
        The only mass that determins how fast something orbits is the mass within the orbit

Remember Kepler's 3rd Law
    p^2 is proportional to a^3
    All the planets in our solar system follow this law

Newton + Kepler = Mass
    p^2 = a^3/(Mass)

The Mass of the Milky Way Galaxy
    But this only measures part of the Galaxy
    We need to find objects at the edge of the galaxy to get a better measurement

    When we look at the edge of the galaxy, 
    If all the mass in the galaxy is what we see, at a certian point far out from the galaxy, the velocity would decrease
    This isn't true which means that the mass of the galaxy continues to increase the further from the center
    The mass of the galaxy doesn't end where it visibly ends

The Dark Matter Halo of the Milky Way Galaxy
    It looks like our galaxy is embedded in a halo of dark matter that surrounds the galaxy

The Mass of the Mikly Way Galaxy
    What could this dark matter be?
    There are things we cannot detect
        Stellar-mass black holes
            Probably not enough of them could have been created
        Brown dwarfs, faint white dwarfs, and red dwarfs
            Best star like option but unlikely
                These are called MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects)
        Weird Subatomic particals
            No evidence so far
                These are called WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)






==========
2018-11-08
==========

The Mass of the Milky Way Galaxy
    The basic idea is the same as measuring our solar system
    For our galaxy, we can use the sun's distance and orbital speed to find the mass contained within our sun's orbit
    To find the total mass, we must pick an object that orbit the edge

    If the mass was only contained in what we see, the orbital motion would be expected to drop of as we move away from the galaxy
    But this is not the case, orbital speed actually increases
    This means there is matter there we cannot see
    
    There have been attempts to measure the MACHOs
    If you look at a dense region long enough, you expect stars to pass in front of each other

Gravitational Lensing: Searching for MACHOs
    When a star passes in front of another, the blocked star will become brighter due to gravitational lensing

Microlensing
    Can accound for 20% of the unseen matter of our galaxy
    More of these studies need to be done

The Galatic Center
    extremely dense with stars

    Weird features are thought to be produced by strong magnetic fields

    Appears to have:
        stellar density a million times higher than near earth
        are right of molecule gas 400 pc across
        Strong magnetic fields
        A rotating ring or disk of matter a few parsecs across
        A strong x-ray source at the center

    Not only we can see the surroundings at different wavelengths, we can resolve stars orbiting around the sagA, but we cannot see sagA
    

Ch24 Galaxies: Building Blocks of the Universe

The Hubble Deep Field
    Looked for a region of space that had no stars in it
    What happens if we leave the telescope open for 10 days pointed at this region?
    If you look anywhere in the sky for long enough, you see a universe full of galaxies
    
Clusters of Galaxies
    Dominated by a much larger galaxy

Many types of galaxies according to their optical morphology
    Spiral
    Barred Spiral
    Barred S0: might have a bar, but don't have spiral arms
    Lenticular (S0): Only disks
    Elliptical: too hot to form stars
    Irregular: lower mass
    Peculiar: galaxies that are interacting with each other, higher mass

Hubble's Galaxy Classification
    Spiral
        Some spirals are tightly wound, large buldge: Sa
        medium wound and buldge: Sb
        Loose and patchy, small buldge: Sc

    The components: disk, core, halo, buldge, and spiral arms

    Sometimes hard to determine if it has spiral arms because we view them edge on

    Spiral Barred (similar to spiral galaxies)
        SBa
        SBb
        SBc

    Elipticals are classified according to their shape from E0 (Almost spherical) to E7 (the most elongated)
        No spiral arms and no disks
        Come in many sizes, from giant with trillions of stars, to dwarfs (might just be a buldge with the rest ripped off) with less than a million of stars

    S0 (lenticular) and SB0 galaxies have a disk and buldge, but no spiral arms and no interstellar gas

    The irregular galaxies are small and have a wide variety of shapes
    Generally has lots of cool gas

    The oldest system comes from Edwin Hubble (Hubble tuning fork)
        Though that elipticals evolved into spirals/barred spirals
            The modern way thinks the opposite

    The Hubble Tuning Fork
        The problem is that many galaxies do not fall into this classification scheme

Hubble-De Vacoluleurs Diagram
    Adds intermediate spirals

Galaxy Zoo Classification Tree (GZ2)
    The general public will be shown a picture of a galaxy and asked questions to classify 

The Distribution of Galaxies in Space
    From Hubble, we know we can use cephiod varable stars
        This only works to a certian distance, before the become too faint to see
            Or they don't exist in the galaxy because they are too old
    If you can figure out the rotation speed of a galaxy, you can figure out its luminosity

Tully-Fisher Relation
    The faster the object is rotation, the more lumionous is
    This is beause faster galaxies are more massive, and there for more luminous

The Distribution of Galaxies in Space
    Another thing we can use to figure out distance to galaxies is Type I Supernovae

    With these additions, the cosmic distance ladder has been extended to about 1 Gpc
    Type I supernova is independent to the other methods, which means we can use it for comparison

    The group of galaxies that the Milky way resides in is called the "local group"
        3 spirals
        lots of satallite galaxies

Galaxy Clusters
    10s - groups
    100s - clusters
    Virgo Clusters
        we are near the outer edge, on our way in

    The Abel Cluster
        The image has 'arcs' throughout the image
        Has a distortion
            Galaxies are creating gravitational lenses Mpc in size

    If we look at distant galaxies, we can see that they are redshifted

The Hubble Tuning Fork
    The initial explanation is not correct, but is used commonly throughout astronomy
    You should know these

The Distributions of Galaxies in Space
    Standard Candles: Objects whose absolute magnitude is known

Tully-Fisher Relation
    correlates a galaxy's rotation speed to its luminosity to estimate mass

Galaxy Clusters
    At larger distances, we see we are in a group
    On the outside of the Virgo Cluster

    As we look at farther distance we see galaxies are receeding from us
    
Hubble's Law
    Distance is corelated with recession speed

Galaxies Receeding
    Hubble found that galxies were rushing away from us, and the further out the faster it is moving

Hubble's Constant
    H naught: The rate of expansion of the cosmos
    Hubble's law ifn the form of an equation: Velocity = H naught x Distance

Knowing the redshift correlates well to determining distance
    Calibrated with Tully-Fisher and Standard Candles

Universal Expansion
    The fabric of space-time is expanding itself
    at larger scales, the expansion of the universe dominates gravity

    When we see light from a distant galaxy, it is being redshifted because of spacetime expanding

    The size of the universe today vs then

Quasars
    seen in the 30s-50s
    In the 60s objects were discovered that were bright in the radio
        Have interesting spectra (not a black body)
    Quasi-stellar radio sources
    Have jets that come out of them
    They emit a tonne of energy that aren't found in stars

Supermassive Black Holes
    Most of the energy is comming from the center of the ecretion disk
        it comes out of the ecreation disk, but it gets reemitted until it becomes infared

Active Galatic Nuclei
    There is a ecreation disk around the black hole

We know that quasars are small becuase the flickering is very quick
    Flicker is determined by size of the object 



Ch25 Galaxies and Dark Matter

Weighing the Galaxy
    
Dark Matter around Galaxies
    Dips and rises are due to the gaps in the galaxy
    Velocity should decrease once we measure orbiting objects
        this is not the case

Dark Matter in Spiral Galaxies
    Our galaxy is similar to others
    10:1 dark matter to regular matter

    For galaxy clusters, we can look at the cluster as a whole and look at the spread of velocities

    Galaxy clusters: 10-100:1 dark matter to regular matter

Dark Matter and Galaxy Collisions
    if you only include visible matter, simulations are not correct
        If you add dark matter, you get accurate simulations

Galaxy Collisions
    close interactions can ignite star formation
    These interactions also fule quasars

Galaxy Formation and Evolution
    When we look at an object 10 billion light years away, we see what they looked like 10 billion years ago
    Younger galaxies do not have the structures of older galaxies
    Galaxies farther away have much more mergers, closer galaxies are more structured
    The amount of mergers drop off over time
        start off low, quickly spike, and then slowly drop off

Galaxy Formation and Evolution
    Mergers are important to how they are formed in the first place
    They are more irregular when younger

Galaxy Merger Tree
    Redshift of 7-8 (quasars)

Galaxy Formation and Evolutions
    Galaxies with higher redshits are farther away and more irregular in shape

Dark Matter Halo Simulation
    
Galaxy Accretion Events
    Minor Mergers
        Larger and smaller galaxy, smaller is disturbed by the gravity of the larger which sometimes rips the small apart and becomes part of the larger
        Smaller can also distort larger galaxy
        Doesn't change it's hubble type
    Major Merger
        galaxies that have similar sizes to each other
        Completely distroy each other and become something new

Mergers and Galaxy Types

Stars don't generally collide with each other, but dust clouds do
    Lots of new star formation

Black Holes in Galaxies
    all but the smallest galaxies have a black hole at it's center
    corrilation between mass of the black hole and the mass of the buldge

    Quasars are powered by black holes

    We see the most quasars at the peak mergers in the universe
        the quasar epoch

The Universe on Large Scales
    If we look at an intermediate distance, we have these voids and walls
        even superclusters are moving together
        voids lose their material to these walls
    If we zoom out even further, the structure goes away and everything seems to be homogeneous
        Everything is the same

    We can learn about the intervening space by careful study of quasar spectra

    We can use this to detect very faint or cold things

Gravitational Lensing on Large Scales
    we can see the same quasar at two different points of times

    Can also be used to estimate the mass of the galaxy that is creating the lense
    
    This is caled Strong Gravitational Lensing

"Weak" gravitational lensing
    don't appear to have much distortion, but with computer software we can determine if it is slightly bent

The 'Bullet Cluster'
    two clusters colliding with each other
    Provides evidence for dark matter existing

CH26 Cosmology

The Universe on the Largest Scales
    This galaxy map shoes the largest structure known in the universe, the Sloan Great Wall. No structure larger than 300Mpc is seen.

    On larger scales structures seem to 'disappear'
    Beyond ~300 Mpc the Universe appears uniform and isotropic

    This pencil beam survey is another measure of large-scale structure. Atain, there is structure at about 200-300Mpc, but nothing larger

    The Universe is actually homogeneous at the larger scales, appears to be isotropic
    The Cosmological Principle includes the assumptions of isotropy and homogeneity

Is the Universe Infinite?
    The sky is dark

    Olber's Paradox:
        if the universe is homogeneous, isotropic, infinite, and has existed for ever, the entire sky should be incredibly bright

A Finite Universe
    So, why is the sky dark at night?
    The universe is homogeneous and isotropic -- it must be finite is spatial extent or in time
    But we know that the Universe is expanding (Hubble's law)
    recession velocity = Hubble constant x Distance

    If Hubble's constant is constant, 14 billion years ago the calculation would still yield 14 billion years ago
        Hubble's constant is not actually constant
    
The Expanding Universe
    Note that Hubble's law is the same no matter who is making the measurements
    Each galaxy will see itself as the center of expansion

    Where was the big bang?
        Everywhere

    When the universe expands, electromagnetic waves are embedded into space-time

    Big Crunch model
        Could also osolate between the two states

    Approaching infinite

    Universe is accelerating due to vaccum energy

    The same analogy can be used to explain the cosmological redshift

The Fate of the Cosmos
    2 possibilities
        Keep expanding forever
        It could collapse
    Assuming that the only relevant...

    If the density is low, the universe will expand forever
    It it is high, the universe will ultimately collapse
    These have different start times for the big bang
        The stars are a little bit older than what is predicted by the big crunch model
        sort of close to the age of the expansion foever model

    Critical density: 
        if the mass of the universe is greater, the universe will stop expanding and collapse on itself, 
        If lower, the universe will expand forever, 
        if is equal, it will eventually reach 0 at infinity (flat universe)
    Evidence points towards the flat universe

Mass-Energy content and Geometry of the Universe
    If the universe has too much matter, the universe will grow, stop growing, and collapse on itself
    If the universe has too little matter, it is infinite
    Flat universe appears to be the geometry we live in

Curved Spacetime
    Triangles
    Flat: sum to 180
    Closed: sum > 180
    Open: sum < 180

The Geometry of Space
    In a closed univers, a proton theoretically would eventually return to the point where it originated from

An Inventory of the Universe
    Ordinary Matter: the adoms that make up planets, stars, galaxies, intergalactic gas -- makes up ~4% of the critical density
    Dark Matter: material holding together galaxies and clusters of galaxies -- ~25% of the critical density
    So what about the rest?

Will the Universe Expand Forever
    Dark matter appears to be some unknown particle but massive, doesn't interact with light

The Expansion of the Universe
    We need to determine how the universe is expanding with time
        Hubble's constant is not constant, changing with time
    We need to measure how far away things are and how fast they are expanding
    We can estimate how long it takes for the Universe to change size by measuring the brightness of standard candles

Clues from distant light beacons: Supernovae
    Type 1a are standard candles
    Their apparent luminosities may be used to track propagation of light in universe

The Expansion History of the Universe
    Different models will have different expansion curves
    We can plot the supernovae to get a expansion curve

Will the Universe Expand Forever
    The data we have indicates that the universe is accelerating
    This is not explained by the current theories that we have

Einstein and the Cosmological Constant
    Before Hubble, Einstein added in a constant to keep his universe static
    It turns out that this cosmological constant can be used to make the universe expand

Will the Universe expand forever
    We can use Type I supernovae as standard candle to test the curve
    Depending on our model, we should have a certain redshift at a certain distance
    What we find is that we have an accelerating universe
    Note that a small error will have a drastic effect on the conclusion we make

    To make our universe expand like how it's modeled, there has to be some energy/force causing it
    Repulsive force

Einstein and the Cosmological COnstant
    Now it seems like the cosmological constant may be necessary to explain the accelerating universe

Dark Energy and Cosmology
    Simplest dark force is Einstein's cosmological constant (Lambda)
    As the universe expands, the universe becomes less dense, which makes the universe accelerate from the cosmological constant

    Different theories will predict ages of the universe
    Right now, we are at a point of time where all of these theories converge
        This seems suspect

Dark Energy = Lambda = Vacuum Energy
    The Uncertainty Principle
    The more precicely you try to measure something in time, the less precise you know it's position

Was there a Big Bang
    Noticed there was a background hiss in the radio antenna
    There should be a signal from the big bang that is highly redshifted
    This is what the hiss was

The Perfect Black Body

Cosmic Microwave Background
    The entire spacetime around us is not 0K
        but 3K
    1s gamma rays are redshifted to the radio waves we see today

    The measured and it exactly fint the curve that they predicted

Light from the farthest frontier
    isotropic to one part in 100000K
        so very smooth, but not homogeneous
    If we look closely enough we see fluctuations

Cobe Maps
    Our motion through the universe
        We see a redshifting because of it
    Dust in our galaxy
        We will have to correct for this
    Primordial Fluctuations
        What existed at the beginning of the universe
        Take away the previous two

We have had a vast increase of resoulution in the cosmic background radiation

Possible Geometries of the Universe
    Spherical
    Flat
    Hyperbolic

Comparison of CMB Observations with Possible Models
    The three geometries will have a different look
    The flat universe looks to be similar to what we observe

The Pie of Ignorance
    If dark energy is real, it makes up the rest of the universe
    We don't know what dark matter and dark energy is
        We can't see it


Ch27 The Early Universe

4 Possible Models of the Universe
    Collapsing
    Apporaching o
    Constant
    Accelerating

    Assume we live in the accelerating universe

Back to the Big Bang
    The total energy of the universe consists of both radiation and matter
    If you go far enough back in time that the temperature would be in the gamma ray spectrum that could destroy perticles
        Radiation dominating
    As you go forward in time, the density would go down and would turn into a matter dominated universe
    Dark energy density is expected to remain constant with time
    Eventually sometime in the future, we will have a dark energy dominated universe
        This is the point where the universe will start to accelerate

Temperature of the Universe
    Today
    Stars form
    Galaxies form
        These happen roughly at the same time
    Atoms form
    Electron and positrons form
    Protons and anti-protons form
    Radiation dominates
    Forces are unified
    Earliest era: rules unknown
As you go back in time, it gets denser and hotter

Particle interactions in the Early Universe
    If you have 2 gamma rays and they interact just right, the will produce particles
        You can create matter out of energy
    Only way to produce Deuterium is the same process that happened in the early universe
        This model predicts a percentage of deuterium that exists
        This percentage matches the estimated deuterium in the universe

Back to the Big Bang
    There would have been an equilibrium between radiation and positron/neutrons
    When the temperature drops the gamma rays can't destroy matter and existing matter 'froze out'

Evolution of the Universe
    WHy do we live in a universe that's made of matter?
        This pair production produces matter and anti-matter
        It is thought that there is more matter produced
        So where is this anti-matter?
            Possibly beyond the horizon that we can't see

    What would the universe begun from
        Calculations predict a singularity, but this might not be ture
        We go bact to 10^-43 seconds after the big bang, plank time
        We can go back to the first frame, but we don't know what happened in this first frame
        We also need physics that we don't know to understand

As we go forward in time, originally the temperatures were so high that the all the particles could be created and destroyed by this background radiation
All the forces are thought to be united
Eventually you reach a point where these forces separate

As soon as the first frame completes, gravity splits off
Fractions of seconds later, strong neuclear, weak neuclear, and electromagnetic split off as well

Back to the Big Bang
    The Lambda (Dark Energy) Cold Dark Matter Model
    There is an inherent energy to space-time itself
        There is a resolution of space-time
    The Plank Scale
    Plank's Constant
    THe consequence
    change in Position x change in Momentum = Plank's Constant / 2
    In this Dark Energy dominated universe, the universe's expantion will start to accelerate

Particle Interactions in the Early Universe
    Positron and Electron have the same mass but opposite charge
    When they collide with each other they are completely anhilated
    As the volume of the universe was smaller, the temp and density of the univere was higher, causing certain particles to be created

Back to the Big Bang
    If the photons are more energetic, they can create and destroy positrons and electrons
    As the photons lose energy, they lose their ability to create and destroy positrons and electrons

Evolution of the Universe
    There reaches a point where neucleus' can be formed
    Why aren't all the heavy elements produced in the big bang?
        Within a star, the pressure and temp are constantly rising
        The opposite is happening in the early universe
            Temp and density is dropping
        Can't continue on to create the heavy elements
    Photons drop low enough that electrons stop binding to the neucleii
    Creation of atoms
    Creation of everything else, stars, 

    Protons and neutrons are made of other particles [quarks (up and down)]
    Need more energetic photons to create them
    In the standard model of physics, exchange particles
    Entire spectrum of particles as the temperature drops
    Universe is growing in size

    When we go all the way back to the beginning, we can predict back to 10^-43 seconds after the big bang

    The forces of nature were though to be combined at the start of the universe
    As the universe expands, the density and temp drops and the photons becomes less energetic
    particles freeze out, with heavier particles freezing out first

    Other things happening
    At certain times the universe will become transparent to certain things
        Neutrinos
        Photons
    The moment where atoms are first formed is when they think the cosmic background radiation comes from

Formation of the Nuclei and Atoms
    Fist produced is Hydrogen
        Deuterium (heavy water)
        These combine to form helium

    The lambda CDM model the relation of the elements
    We can look at the original compositions and see that the actual proportions match the model

    When we look backwards in time, we come to this limit to where we can't see further
    Cosmic background radiation comes from this limit
    Similar to what happens when we see clouds

The Inflationary Universe
    The Horizon Problem
        Region A and B are essentially identicle
            Why is this?

    The Flatness Problem:
        We need the perfect amount of matter to make this true
            Why is this?

    Very early on, after this plank time, the universe would have expanded faster the speed of light
    There is nothing saying that space-time itself can't move faster than the speed of light
    Opposite points of the universe are expanding away from each other faster than the speed of light
    When it expands very quickly, it helps solve the Horizon and Flatness problem

    Horizon Model
        Point A and B would be in thermal contact with each other

    Flatness Model
        If we imagine that the universe could have any geometry and blow it up big enough, it would seem like the geometry would be flat
        The part of the universe we can see is flat

A quantum vacuum energy fluctruation may have spawned our universe
    Energy can fluctuate, and its possible that the energy could become non-zero and expand
    It seems this vacuum energy is real
    These quantum fluctuations are real

    Quantum fluctuations are predicted to 
        Have a vast range of what they could be

Formation of Structure
    Dark matter appears to be a particle that is much more massive and has a charge of 0
        Would have formed very early on
        Because of the 0 charge, it doesn't react to electromagnetic radiation
    Charged particals are heavily influenced by photons
    We would have dark matter created early one, normal matter a short time later
    Normal matter is heavily influeced by radiation and radiaton will prevent normal matter from clumping together
    Dark matter isn't affected by this, and is affected by gravity
    This would mean dark matter would start clumping early on
    When normal matter starts to clump, dark matter is already clumped together
    Dark matter is the seed for what we see today
    
    All of the modern simulations have dark matter in them
    If you don't include it, you don't evolve things correctly

Cosmic Structure and the Microwave Background
    By looking at the cosmic background radiation, we can look for the signatures that dark matter would have created
